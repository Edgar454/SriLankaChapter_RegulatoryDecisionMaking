Green sand characteristics:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- Refractoriness: The sand's ability to withstand the temperature of the liquid metal being cast without breaking down. Sand with too low refractoriness will melt and fuse to the casting.\\\\r\\\\n- Chemical inertness: The sand must not react with the metal being cast.\\\\r\\\\n- Permeability: The sand's ability to exhaust gases. This is important to avoid casting defects, such as blow holes and gas holes.\\\\r\\\\n- Surface finish: The size and shape of the sand particles defines the best surface finish achievable. Finer particles lead to producing a better finish. However, finer the particle, the permeability becomes worse.\\\\r\\\\n- Cohesiveness (or bond): The ability of the sand to retain a given shape after the pattern is removed.\\\\r\\\\n- Flowability: The ability for the sand to flow into intricate details and tight corners.\\\\r\\\\n- Collapsibility: The ability of the sand to be easily stripped off the casting after it has solidified. Special additives can be used to avoid cracking and hot tears in the casting during cooling or with long freezing temperature ranges.\\\\r\\\\n- Availability/cost: The availability and cost of the sand is especially important because for every ton of metal poured, three to six tons of sand is required. Although sand can be screened and reused, the particles eventually become too fine and require periodic replacement with fresh sand.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt is economical to use two different sands:\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\n- a. Facing sand: this sand will be built up around the pattern to a thickness of 30 to 100 mm.\\\\r\\\\n- b. Backing sand: the sand that fills in around the facing sand. This sand is simply silica sand with only a small amount of binder and no special additives.\\\"\",\n          \"b'# Fig. 4.
