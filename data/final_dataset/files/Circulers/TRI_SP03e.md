# 1. Introduction

Balanced nutrition plays a key role in the maintenance of tea plantations. The cost of fertiliser application varies from 6 to 12% of the total cost of production. Hence, cost-effective investment in fertiliser is necessary to manage a plantation as a commercially viable enterprise.

The response of the tea plant to NPK fertilisers is influenced by several factors such as climate, soil, plant and cultural practices. These factors vary widely between tea growing regions and therefore the plant response to fertiliser is different in different mature tea growing regions. In the present fertiliser recommendations, regional differences have been taken into consideration in order to optimise productivity and profitability of the land.

# 2.0 Amelioration of soil pH in mature tea fields

The maintenance of suitable soil pH levels is an important practice in soil fertility management.

# 2.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone

Application of dolomitic limestone is recommended to maintain soil pH between 4.5 and 5.5. The rates of dolomite indicated below should be applied depending on pH level, preferably a few weeks before pruning. The soil pH should be checked prior to every prune.
# Soil pH

|Soil pH|Dolomite (kg/ha)|
|---|---|
|Below 3.9|2500|
|From 3.9 up to 4.2|2000|
|From 4.2 up to 4.5|1500|
|Above 4.5|1000|

# 21.1 Specifications

The dolomitic limestone must have a minimum of 18% MgO, and approximately 100% of particles passing through 30 mesh, and 40 to 60% of particles passing through 100 mesh:

# Plant Response to ground applied nutrients

The optimum range of N; P and K nutrients (kg/ha/yr) required by seedling and VP teas for maximum yield response in different tea growing regions are given in Table 1.

# Table 1 - N, P and K requirements for seedling and VP tea in different tea growing regions

| |Up country|Mid-country|Low country|Uva| |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Seedling tea|N|90|180|90|220|
| |P2O5|25|25|25|25|
| |K2O|70|70|50|100|
|VP tea|N|270|400|270|400|
| |P2O5| |35| |35|
| |K2O|100|140|100|140|

# 3.1 Basal mixtures

To supply the required nutrients, three basal mixtures have been formulated separately for seedling and VP tea: The designation of each mixture identifies the type of tea and the region:

# 3.1.1 Designation

- STIUM - Seedling tea mixture for low country
- STILC - Seedling tea mixture for up and mid-country
- STIUVA - Seedling tea mixture for Uva
- VPIUM - Mature VP tea mixture for up and mid-country
- VPILC - Mature VP tea mixture for low country
- VPIUVA - Mature VP tea mixture for Uva
# 3.1.2 Composition

# Seedling tea mixtures:

| |STIUM|STILC|STIUVA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Urea parts|196 (90 N)|196 (90 N)|196 (90 N) 89 (25 PzOs)|
|ERP parts|87 (25 PzOs)|86 (25 PzOs)| |
|MOP parts|117 (70 KzO)|83 (50 KzO)|150 (90 KzO)|
| |40Q|365|435|

The seedling tea mixtures contain approximately: 22.5% N, 6.2% PzOs and 17.6% KzO

STIUM 400

STILC 365 24.7% N, 6.7% PzOs and 13.6% KzO

STIUVA 435 20.7% N, 5.8% PzOs and 20.7% KzO

# VP tea mixtures:

| |VPIUM|VPILC|VPIUVA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Urea parts|587 (270 N)|587 (270 N)|587 (270 N)|
|ERP parts|123 (35 PzOs)|126 (35 PzOs)|125 (35 PzOs)|
|MOP parts|200 (120 KzO)|16Z (100 KzO)|233 (140 KzO)|
| |910|88Q|945|

The VP mixtures contain approximately:

VPIUM 910 29.7% N, 3.9% PzOs and 13.2% KzO

VPILC 880 30.79 N, 4.1% PzOs and 11.4% Kzo

VPIUVA 945 28.6% N, 3.8% PzOs and 14.8% KzO

# 3.2 Fertiliser applications based on "potential yield"

Calculation of annual N-fertiliser requirement for yield may be defined as the highest yield given tea field is based on "potential yield". The annual potential achieved in the particular year of the pruning cycle, based on the immediate past three cycles.

The application of fertiliser to mature seedling or VP fields should be based on such calculated potential yields. The method of calculation of potential yield for every 12-month period from prune is given below:

Tabulate the annual yield data of each field (kg made tea per ha per year) over the previous 3 cycles (15 years, if the cycle has 5 years): However, if data is not available for three cycles, the data of the past two cycles may be used:
An example is given in Table 2.

# Table 2

Yield record of 12-month periods from pruning (kg made tea per year)

|Cycle|1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1st|1037|2053|1941|1708|926|
|2nd|884|1893|1826|1573|866|
|3rd|990|2140|2090|1650|895|

The highest achieved yield (potential yield) for the given year in the cycle is 1037, 2140, 2090, 1708 and 926 for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th year, respectively.

Select the N-level corresponding to each of the potential yields from Table 3.

# Table 3

Annual requirement of nitrogen for the potential yield

|Potential yield (kg made tea per ha per year)|Requirement of nitrogen (kg N per ha per year)|
|---|---|
|Less than 900|90|
|900-1300|140|
|1300-1500|160|
|1500-1700|180|
|1700-1900|200|
|1900-2000|220|
|2000-2500|270|
|2500-3000|320|
|3000-3500|360|
|Above 3500|400|

The quantity of nitrogen to be applied in the respective years is therefore:

| |1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|12 months|1037|2140|2090|1708|926|
|N to be applied (kg per ha per year)|140|270|270|200|140|

Once the quantity of nitrogen per ha per year is determined for each field, the quantity per application is calculated according to the number of applications that is practically possible. The number of applications should be determined on the basis of the agro-climatic conditions, as well as on the cropping pattern of the relevant region.
# 3.3 Quantity of nutrients, basal mixture and urea, application frequencies and dosages

The quantities of nutrients required, inclusive of the basal mixture and urea, and the applicable frequencies and dosages corresponding to the potential yield category for seedling and VP teas, are given in Tables 4 and 5.

# 3.4 Foliar and other ground fertiliser applications

Foliar applications of fertiliser for mature tea should be made with knapsack sprayers:

# 3.4.1 Zinc sulphate

Zinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 6 and 11 kg per ha per year, for fields yielding less than, and above, 2000 made tea kg per ha per year, respectively. This should be done in four applications, i.e: 1.5 and 2.75 kg in 400 ha per application. Zinc sulphate should be applied within 7 days after ground fertiliser application:

# 3.4.2 Other nutrients

If deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) are observed, apply 2 to 4% of urea: Apply 8 to 16 kg of urea per ha in 400 litres of water, as and when necessary. If deficiency symptoms of manganese (interveinal chlorosis and reddish brown necrotic spots on leaf blade) are observed, test the soil pH. If it is above 5.5, apply 2% manganese sulphate until symptoms disappear, preferably at 3 to 4 week intervals: In addition, withhold the scheduled application of dolomite.

# 3.4.3 Epsom salt and kieserite for correcting magnesium deficiency

When magnesium deficiency symptoms are observed, spray commercial Epsom salt initially, at the rate of 48 kg per ha per year in four applications, at intervals of three months. Commercial Epsom salt, zinc sulphate and urea can be mixed together and applied as a single foliar spray, when required: The quantity of urea and Epsom salt could be adjusted depending on the severity of deficiency symptoms. However, do not exceed 5% total salt concentration in the final spray solution. (NB: Zinc sulphate and Epsom salt are both salts.) After application of the above, test the soil for Mg content: If it is below the critical level (60 ppm): apply kieserite at the rate of 125 kg per ha per year by mixing with basal NPK mixture or with urea in situ.

Note: 1. proportionately: For fields yielding below 2000 kg per ha per year; the nitrogen level may be reduced. The quantity per application may be adjusted to suit the seasonal variation in yield as well as age from pruning. Where the bulk is large, the number of applications may be increased: Urea could be bulked with the basal mixture.
# 3.4.4 Soil application of boron

Soil application of boron is recommended at the rate of 4.5 kg per ha per year. When symptoms of boron deficiency are observed in shade trees, borate (borax) should be mixed with basal NPK mixture or urea in situ:

# 3.4.5 Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects

Sulphate of potash is recommended for mature tea, to be applied prior to an anticipated drought and in areas that are prone to frequent drought damage. A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 8 kg in 400 liters of water) is recommended at fortnightly intervals, commencing at least a month prior to the onset of the dry period. Spray immediately after harvesting to ensure proper deposition on the mature foliage. Urea (2%) may be included in the spray solution to increase the efficiency of potassium absorption. Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.
