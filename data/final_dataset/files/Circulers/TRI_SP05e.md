# FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TEA SEED BEARERS

This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No: F 17, Serial No 07/94, issued in June 1994 on the use of fertiliser for tea seed bearers.

# 1.0 Fertiliser mixtures for young tea seed bearers

# 1.1 From field planting to 2nd year

The mixture T200 is recommended for young tea plants.

# 1.1 Composition of T200

|100 parts|Sulphate of ammonia|(20.6% N)|
|---|---|---|
|50 parts|Eppawela rock phosphate|(28.5% P2O5)|
| | |(60% K2O)|
|25 parts|Muriate of potash| |
|25 parts|Kieserite|(24% MgO)|
|200 parts| | |

The MgO mixture contains approximately 10.3% N, 6.9% P2O5, 7.5% K2O and 3.0% MgO.

# 1.12 Dosage and frequency of application

Applications can commence approximately two months after planting: Apply four times in the 1st year, and 21 or 32 g per plant per application six or four times in the 2nd year; T200 at the rates of 15 or 21 g per plant per application six or times in the 2nd year.

# 1.2 Third and 4th year

The mixture T750 is recommended for 3rd and 4th year plants:

# 1.21 Composition of T750

|500 parts|Sulphate of ammonia|(20.6% N)|
|---|---|---|
|100 parts|Eppawela rock phosphate|(28.5% P2O5)|
|100 parts|Muriate of potash|(60% K2O)|
|50 parts|Kieserite|(24% MgO)|
|250 parts| | |

The MgO mixture contains approximately 13.7% N, 3.7% P2O5, 8.0% K2O and 1.8% MgO.
# 1.22 Dosage and frequency of application

Apply T750 at the rate of 60 and 100 g per plant per application in the 3rd and the 4th year, respectively. The number of applications is four in each year.

# 1.3 Fertiliser mixture for mature tea seed bearers

# 1.3.1 Composition of U330

|130 parts|Urea|(46% N)|
|---|---|---|
|100 parts|Eppawela rock phosphate|(28.5% P2O5)|
|100 parts|Muriate of potash|(60% K2O)|
|330 parts|330 parts|330 parts|

The mixture contains approximately 18.1% N, 8.6% P2O5 and 18.2% K2O.

# 1.3.2 Dosage and frequency of application

Apply U330 at the rate of 275 g per plant per application three times in each year. It is important to avoid fertiliser applications in the 3 months prior to flowering:
