# Dear Sir/Madam,

# MINIMUM QUALITY STANDARD FOR TEA

As you may have been already informed by your Brokers, Sri Lanka Tea Board has decided to permit the sale of any grade of Tea falling below the minimum quality standard based on I.S.0. 3720 which is currently in force in Sri Lanka, through the normal Private Sale procedure. However, this decision does not apply to the disposal of Refuse Tea which is governed by the provisions of the Tea Control Act No.51 of 1957.

Please note that Teas sold through the Private Sale procedure in terms of the above decision should not be taken into account for the calculation of the monthly net sale average for payment of the Reasonable Price for Green Tea Leaf with effect from the payment for the month of September, 1987.

Yours faithfully,

Sgd. /R. L. Weerasekera

Actg. TEA COMMISSIONER.
