Damaged Made Tea due to Natural Causes and otherwise

Sri Lanka Tea Board observes that owners of made tea, in various stages of the
disposal channels manage to minimize their losses, due to damages caused to made tea
on account of natural causes or otherwise through insurance covers. This loss recovery
mechanism culminates with the releasing of a considerable volume of damaged teas,
which are either contaminated with Microbiological elements or Chemical substances in
to the export blends through unscrupulous parties. This has tarnished the image of
‘Ceylon Tea’ abroad, damaging the reputation established by the exporters, over decades
of hard work.

rt ;
o2. Considering the adverse repercussion of the said unethical trading practice, it has
been decided to monitor such transactions, with immediate effect.

03. Where any tea is damaged due to natural causes and otherwise that will deem the
said tea unfit for sale through approved channels or otherwise, shall be declared by the
registered exporter, manufacturer or produce broker to the Sri Lanka Tea Board, within
a period of one week from the said incident and an acknowledgement obtained.
Specimen Form for this purpose is annexed. No such teas should be released to an
insurance company or its agent or any other person without the prior written consent of
the Sri Lanka Tea Board.
