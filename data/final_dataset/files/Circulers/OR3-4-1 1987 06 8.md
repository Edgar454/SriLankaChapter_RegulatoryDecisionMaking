Dear Sir,

# MINIMUM QUALITY STANDARD FOR TEA

The Tea Board at its meeting held on 28th May, 1987 reviewed the current minimum quality standard for tea and made the following decisions:

1. The Minimum Quality Standard based on ISO 3720, which is currently in force in Sri Lanka, be continued unchanged;
2. The standard be applied at the point of export and not for domestic sales;
3. The Board will set up the necessary mechanism to ensure that exporters adhere to the Minimum Standard in servicing export orders;
4. The Minimum Standard panel consisting of representatives of the Tea Board, JEDB, SLSPC, TSHDA, Tea Brokers and the Tea Trade will continue to function to review appeals made by exporters relating to the Minimum Quality Standard;
5. The Sri Lanka Tea Board may, in due course, take necessary regulations under its Act to ensure the enforcement of the Minimum Quality Standard for tea exports.

The Tea Board has also decided that ISO 3720 standard will continue as the standard for sales at Colombo Tea Auctions and that teas below this standard should not be catalogued for sale at the Auctions. However, producers would be permitted to sell any grade of tea below this standard through normal private sale procedures, such as blending or reclaiming to upgrade the good teas above the 3720 Standard.
