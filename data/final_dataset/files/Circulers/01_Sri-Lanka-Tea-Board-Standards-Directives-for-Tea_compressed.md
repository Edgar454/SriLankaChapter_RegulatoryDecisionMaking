1st January, 2021

# To ALL REGISTERED TEA MANUFACTURERS, TEA EXPORTERS AND IMPORTERS OF TEA FOR VALUE ADDITION AND RE-EXPORT OF THE SAME

Dear Sirs,

Sri Lanka Tea Board Standards Directives for Tea Issued under the Sri Lanka Tea Board Law No. 14 of 1975, Tea Control Act No 51 of 1957, Tea (Tax & Control of Export) Act No 16 of 1959 and Sri Lanka (Import & Export) Scheme for import of tea for blending and export thereafter Regulations 1981.

(This Circular Supersedes Tea Board Circular No AL/MQS-Rev/2010, issued on 26th April 2010)

Sri Lanka Tea Board as the monitoring authority of quality standard of teas exported is mandated to protect the image of 'Ceylon tea' established globally. As you are aware, Tea Board has introduced a set of standards revised in 2010 under the power vested by its Act. As a protective measure of teas produced from Sri Lanka, Tea Board has introduced and implements Standards and Directives for "Sri Lankan Origin Teas" and "Other Origin Teas" which are imported for re-export purposes. The Minimum Quality Standard (MQS) will cover both ISO 3720 for Black Tea and ISO 11287 for Green Tea;

# 02.

The directives pertaining to the limits indicated in this circular (Annexure other than the established ISO standards i.e Extraneous matters, Detectable Metals, Microbial Contaminants and Maximum Residue Limits of Pesticides etc,) are required to be complied by all registered manufacturers and exporters of Sri Lankan Origin Tea.

# 03.

The limits indicated in the Annexure B are considered as standards and should be strictly applicable for all other origin teas at the point of importation and exportation of the same after value addition. Hence non-conformity of such standards in any other origin teas will be treated as grounds for rejection of import re-export.

# 04.

The above Directives and Standards are implemented with effect from 1st January, 2021.
