Lack of water bodies, geographical limitations and inability to use conventional irrigation techniques such as flood and furrow irrigation have hindered the application of irrigation in tea plantations. Introduction of micro irrigation techniques viz. drip and sprinkler irrigation, frequent drought occurrences and productivity improvements etc. have prompted stakeholders to seek alternative techniques to manage soil moisture levels. Also, high impact droughts, impacts of climate change and poor replanting rates have created renewed interests in adopting suitable irrigation techniques. It is evident that rudimentary to modern irrigation techniques have been practiced in tea fields although adoption of such techniques is not feasible in the entire plantation. However, there are tea fields, where irrigation could be applied with the development of in-situ water bodies. Since management of soil moisture levels plays a pivotal role in sustainable crop production, it is necessary to advise stakeholders to take correct decisions on adoption of suitable irrigation techniques. This guideline serves as a basis for decision making on irrigation as a potential drought mitigation strategy in tea plantation.\\n\\n__nn_distance: 0.6684095859527588\\nissue_date: December 2021\\nissuing_authority: Tea Research Institute\\nclass: guideline\\nreference_number: 04/2021\\ntitle: Interim Guidelines on Strategic Cost Component Management in Tea Cultivation with Special Reference to Rational Use of Plant Nutrients and Tea Manufacture\\noriginal_doc_id: 95\\n\\n# 2.4\\r\\n\\r\\nUse suitable machines for labour intensive operations such as plucking, pruning and weeding\\n\\n__nn_distance: 0.6684046983718872\\nissue_date: December 2018\\nissuing_authority: Tea Research Institute\\nclass: guideline\\nreference_number: 02/2018\\ntitle: GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF CO-3 GRASS (HYBRID NAPIER) FOR SOIL REHABILITATION BEFORE REPLANTING OF TEA IN THE LOW COUNTRY\\noriginal_doc_id: 84\\n\\n# GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF CO-3 GRASS (HYBRID NAPIER) FOR SOIL REHABILITATION BEFORE REPLANTING OF TEA IN THE LOW COUNTRY\\n\\n__nn_distance: 0.6681361198425293\\nissue_date: December 2018\\nissuing_authority: Tea Research Institute\\nclass: guideline\\nreference_number: 03/2018\\ntitle: GUIDELINE FOR CLEFT GRAFTING IN TEA NURSERIES\\noriginal_doc_id: 85\\n\\n# Scion\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the upper component of the graft.

Therefore, blades with tungsten carbide tips (around 100) are ideal for tea pruning. Engine should be throttled adequately before the cut is made.\\r\\n- The cut should be preferably made by using one-third of the blade (circumference) from the front to the left (see Figure 2). Blade with broken or blunt tips should not be used for pruning.\\r\\n- Few branches nearest to the operator should be cut first at the recommended height and the balance should be removed progressively (step wise) at the same height by swinging the pruner (from the right to left) while moving forward.\\r\\n- Branches should be cut by exerting a mild pressure to the blade. The blade should never be dashed towards the frame of the tea bush as it damages the blade and the branches.\\r\\n- It is dangerous to try and remove branches/twigs or other matter entangled with the blade if any, while the engine is running.\\r\\n- One or two healthy and peripheral branches having 200-300 leaves on the left-side of the bush should be left as lungs.\\r\\n- Branches should be removed so that the top surface of the bush frame follows the slope of the land.\\r\\n- Manual cleaning of the frames by removing knots, damaged, dead, diseased and pest attacked branches is essential after the machine pruning to preserve the bush health.\\r\\n- The remnant fuel if any should be removed from the tank and those in the carburetor should also be burnt by running the engine for few minutes until it automatically stops at the end of the day.\\n\\n__nn_distance: 0.6666287183761597\\nissue_date: December 2018\\nissuing_authority: Tea Research Institute\\nclass: guideline\\nreference_number: 02/2018\\ntitle: GUIDELINES ON THE USE OF CO-3 GRASS (HYBRID NAPIER) FOR SOIL REHABILITATION BEFORE REPLANTING OF TEA IN THE LOW COUNTRY\\noriginal_doc_id: 84\\n\\n# Planting of CO-3 Grass\\r\\n\\r\\n- After uprooting old tea, prepare and level the land for planting of grasses.

The soil quality is defined as the soil’s capacity to perform within managed ecosystem boundaries to sustain plant productivity while reducing soil degradation. A range of soil parameters or indicators has been identified to estimate soil quality, depending on crop, adoption of agricultural practices and crop interactions with environments. As to local tea cultivation, soil bulk density (BD; gram per cm3), available water content (AWC; mm per 30 cm), organic carbon (C; %) and microbial biomass content (MBC μg per gram of soil) from a depth of 0-30 cm, have been used to compute the soil quality indices for different tea growing regions. The scores given to averages of each of the above parameters and their variations in the Index are given in Table 1. Each parameter was provisionally assigned with weighted average and they were later validated from the actual data and their relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nPage 1 of 3\\n\\n__nn_distance: 0.6658726930618286\\nissue_date: December 2021\\nissuing_authority: Tea Research Institute\\nclass: guideline\\nreference_number: 04/2021\\ntitle: Interim Guidelines on Strategic Cost Component Management in Tea Cultivation with Special Reference to Rational Use of Plant Nutrients and Tea Manufacture\\noriginal_doc_id: 95\\n\\n# 3.4\\r\\n\\r\\nStrictly monitor and reduce energy consumption by an appropriate energy (electrical and thermal) management plan.

It involves a specific height and slope to ensure optimal growth and health of the tea bushes. The technical details include using a specialized machine with a rotating blade that cuts the branches at a specific angle, typically from the front to the left, using one-third of the blade's circumference. The machine should be used with a steady hand, applying mild pressure, and moving from right to left while the machine is in motion. This process helps in maintaining the required height and slope of the tea bushes, following the natural slope of the land.\\nNew Answer: \"}], 'model': 'llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview', 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.0}}\n",
