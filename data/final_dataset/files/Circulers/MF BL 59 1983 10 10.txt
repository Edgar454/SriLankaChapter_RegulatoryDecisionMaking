Tos Al1 kegistered Tea Manufacturers,

Dear Sir/Madam,

Sale of BM Fannings

The Sri Lanka Tea Board has decided to permit the sale of
BM Fannings by public auction.

Ze In view of this, BH Fannings must be treated as if it were

a grade of tea. It will now be exported and consumed as a foode-

stuff. It is therefcre essential that care should be taken in
its preparation, handling and storage under the most strict
hygienic conditions in order to prevent microbial contamination
at factory level. Every effort should be made to avoid storing
it for long pericds, particularly under damp conditions, and
also to keep out all extraneous matter. ;

3.00 It will be necessary for all due precautions to be taken

‘in the preparation. of: BM Fannings. just as it is necessary to

take such precautions for. the familiar grades of tea sold at
the Auctions. | ,

Yours faithfully |

Sed. G.eA. de Silva

Tea Commissioner. |
