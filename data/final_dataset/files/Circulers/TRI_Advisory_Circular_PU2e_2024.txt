T.R.I. ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.PUPPy

 

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 02/24

CHEMICAL CONTROL OF DISEASES

(This Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PU2 Serial No. 02/23 issued in March 2023 and previous
related circulars and links with Circular Nos. DM1, DM2, DM3, DM4, DM5, DM6 & DM7)

1. Introduction
For disease management in tea, an integrated approach inclusive of cultural, biological and
chemical methods is recommended as specified in Advisory Circulars DM1 — DM7.

Two fundamental groups of fungicides are used to control tea diseases. They are either contact or
systemic. Contact fungicides can kill a pathogen (fungus) only upon contact and are not absorbed
into plant tissues. Systemic fungicides on the other hand have the ability to be absorbed into plant
tissues and therefore may leave behind residues for a longer period with better controllability. This
can become counterproductive when it comes to residues in the final product (made tea).
Therefore, this makes necessary to take all the precautions in resorting to control diseases using
systemic fungicides. It is very important to use only the recommended fungicides as per TRI
guidelines following the required Pre Harvest Interval (PHI).

This disease is prevalent in Low country region. When applying chemicals, it is essential to wet the
green stems and older wood with the spray solution, on which the alga is sporulating.
