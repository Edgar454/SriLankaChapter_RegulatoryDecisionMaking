Dear Sir/Maden,

# Payment of Reasonable Price for Green Leaf

purchased by Tea Factories

Iour kind attention is drawn to my Circular Letter No. BL.74 dated 10th April, 1987, regarding the calculation of the Reasonable Price payable for Green Tea Leaf.

1. As per above Circular Letter, incentive payment of 50% of the BxCO85 elevational average during any month Sale Average Price over and above the particular month.
2. The elevational average is calculated based on the quantity of teas actually sold at the Auctions (quantity less samples) and the Nett proceeds (less Advalorem Sales Tax). Therefore, calculating the monthly factory Nett Sale Average to determine the incentive entitlement, you should divide the Nett Sale Proceeds by the quantity actually sold at the Auctions, i.e., for calculating the elevational average.
