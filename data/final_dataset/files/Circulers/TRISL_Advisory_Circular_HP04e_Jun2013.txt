REJUVENATION PRUNING
(This replaces theCircular No.P2Serial No.13/92)
Theremoval oftheinhibitory effects ofoldageandtherestoration ofthevigour oftheyoung is
rejuvenation. Sections oftheageing oldteafields become weakened toastateofbeing nolonger ableto
withstand therigours ofnormal cultivation andtheadverse impacts oftheenvironment, including the
changes oftheweather aswellasthatoftheattack bypestsanddiseases. Suchilleffects leadto:
1.Poorornon-recovery fromprune andeventual death ofbushes, withresulting vacancies
2.Anincrease intheexistence ofeconomically non-viable "passenger" teabushes
3.Increased susceptibility topestsanddiseases affecting theframe androots
Objectives
Theoverail rejuvenation programme aimsatarresting thedecline outlined above andtorestore, atleast
inpart,thevigour oftheafflicted sections ofthefieldbyrejuvenation pruning aswellasbyinfilling, to
helpbring backthefieldtoastate ofbeing economically viable. Theindiscriminate uprooting of
deep-rooted oldseedling teabushes forpurposes oflargescalereplanting, leadtoenormous amounts of
soildisturbance andlosses, especially onsloping terrain. Inorder toavertsuchdisturbances andlosses on
suchsloping terrain, thefields inthese locations could possibly betaken themselves torejuvenation
pruning andconsolidation byinfilling.
Fields with potential, forrejuvenation
Fields thataremarginal andnon-retrievable toastateofeconomic viability aswellasfields thatare
earmarked forreplanting within thenexttenyears, should beleftout.Theselection criteria forthe
remaining fieldsarebased onthefollowing:
1
1.There should notbeawidespread incidence ofrootdisease suchasPoria orrootpestssuchas
heavy incidence ofplantparasitic nematodes ortheup-country live-wood teatermites
2.Thecollar/base ofthebushes toberenovated should notbedebilitated
3.Atleast50%ofthestand should betaken themselves torejuvenation pruning
4.There should beagooddepth ofsoilwiththeabsence ofsurface gravel orrocksandboulders
Preparation oftheselected field
1.Thefieldshould befullyrested foraperiod notlessthansixmonths.
2.Aminimum oftwofertilizer applications should begivenduring therestphase bushby
bush, providing theequivalent of60kgNperhaperapplication fromtherecommended
mixture.
3.Itispreferable togiveaquantity ofabout 6to8metric tonsofwelldecomposed compost
(amixture ofwelldecomposed refuse teaandanyother suitable green matter) perhectare.
4. Therejuvenation pruning should becarried outwiththeonset ofthewetweather (Western
Sector -S.W.monsoon andEastern Sector -N.E.monsoon). Thepruned litter(brushwood)
should beimmediately buried inshallow trenches (20to30cmdepth), cutinalternate
contour rows.
5.Thecutsurfaces andshaved offwounds onthestumps should bepainted overwitha
recommended wound-dressing. Please referAdvisory Circular Nos.PU2andPU4andon
chemical control ofdiseases andchemical control ofinsect, miteandnematode pests
respectively.
6.Dolomitic limestone isrecommended tobeapplied attherateofabout 1to2.5metric
tons/ha (depending onsoilacidity) priortopruning (please referAdvisory Circular No.SP3
onFertilizer recommendations formature tea)
7. Inareas prone toBlister Blight leafdisease, special careshould betaken toprevent the
outbreaks ontherecovering shoots, bystrictly adhering totherecommendations given in
Advisory Circulars No.DM1andPU2onprotection ofteafromblister blight andChemical
control ofdiseases respectively.

8. During recovery ofthepruned field,aconcerted infilling programme needs tobecarried
outwithspecifically grown 18-month-old nursery plants oftheappropriate cultivars
raised injumbo polythene sleeves.
9. Infilling should commence soonafterpruning, within themonsoon thatimmediately
follows theprune. Infilling ofcasualties maycontinue during thefollowing monsoon aswell.The
plants forinfilling should beraised wellontimebyproper programming. Theinfilling programme
oftherejuvenated fieldshould aimatatarget bushpopulation ofatleast8000bushes perha.
10. Tipping should bedoneataheight ofabout 60cm(24inches) fromground levelwith
themainobjective ofdeveloping thickandhealthy pruning frames.
