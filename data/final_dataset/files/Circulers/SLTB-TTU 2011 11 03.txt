SRI LANKA TEA BOARD

SLTB/TTU 03' November 2011.

Deputy Director (Tech.)

Tea Tasting Unit
International Standard ISO 3720 & ISO 11287

selling brokers by producing samples of tea which conform the Minimum Quality
Standard on leaf appearance under both standards. Board directed me to introduce the
specimen standard samples of tea through Tea Tasting Unit or Lab to the trade.

You may therefore take action to prepare minimum 15 samples of tea (each
100grm-150grm) of Minimum Quality Standard of both black and green. 8 such samples
can handover to 8 selling brokers as specimen to follow suit for monitoring. Other
reserve standard samples can be used within the institution for inquiry from any party

who feed to vprify the M.Q.Standard of made tea.

Copy: 1. Director, TRI
2. Deputy Tea Commissioner — Tea Exports Section
3. Assistant Director (Lab) — If the Lab can prepare similar standard specimen
samples it would be easy for the TTU.
