1 Introduction

Balanced nutrition plays a key role in the maintenance of tea plantations. The
cost of fertiliser application varies from 6 to 12% of the total cost of production.
Hence, cost-effective investment in fertiliser is necessary to manage a plantation
as a commercially viable enterprise.

The response of the tea plant to NPK fertilisers is influenced by several factors
such as climate, soil, plant and cultural practices. These factors vary widely
between tea growing regions and therefore the plant response to fertiliser is
different in different tea growing regions. In the present fertiliser
recommendations for mature tea, regional differences have been taken into
consideration in order to optimise productivity and profitability of the land.

2.0 Amelioration of soil pH in mature tea fields

The maintenance of suitable soil pH levels is an important practice in soil fertility
management.

2.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone

Application of dolomitic limestone is recommended to maintain soil pH between 4.5
and 5.5.

The soil pH should be checked prior to every prune, and the rates of dolomite
indicated below should be applied depending on pH level, preferably a few weeks
before pruning.
3.1

Soil pH Dolomite (kg/ha)

Below 3.9 2500
From 3.9 up to 4.2 2000
From 4.2 up to 4.5 1500
Above 4.5 1000
Specifications

The dolomitic limestone must have a minimum of 18% MgO, and approximately
100% of particles passing through 30 mesh, and 40 to 60% of particles passing
through 100 mesh.

Plant Response to ground applied nutrients

The optimum range of N, P and K nutrients (kg/ha/yr) required by seedling and
VP teas for maximum yield response in different tea growing regions are given in
Table 1.

Basal mixtures

To supply the required nutrients, three basal mixtures have been formulated
separately for seedling and VP tea. The designation of each mixture identifies the
type of tea and the region.

Designation

ST/UM - Seedling tea mixture for up and mid-country
ST/LC - Seedling tea mixture for low country

ST/UVA - Seedling tea mixture for Uva

VP/UM - Mature VP tea mixture for up and mid-country
VP/LC - Mature VP tea mixture for low country

VP/UVA - Mature VP tea mixture for Uva

3.2 Fertiliser applications based on "potential yield”

Calculation of annual N-fertiliser requirement for a given tea field is based on
"potential yield”. The annual potential yield may be defined as the highest yield
achieved in the particular year of the pruning cycle, based on the immediate past
three cycles.

The application of fertiliser to mature seedling or VP fields should be based on such
calculated potential yields. The method of calculation of potential yield for every 12-
month period from prune is given below:

Tabulate the annual yield data of each field (kg made tea per ha per year) over the
previous 3 cycles (15 years, if the cycle has 5 years). However, if data is not
available for three cycles, the data of the past two cycles may be used.

 
An example is given in Table 2.

Table 2 - Yield record of 12-month periods from pruning (kg made tea/ha/yr)

Year after prune
Cycle ist 2nd 3rd 4th Sth
1st 1037 2053 1941 1708 926
2nd 884 1893 1826 1573 866
3rd 990 2140 2090 1650 895

The highest achieved yield (potential yield) for a given year in the cycle is
underlined. These are 1037, 2140, 2090, 1708 and 926 for the 1%, 2", 3 4", 5”
year, respectively.

Select the N-level corresponding to each of the potential yields from Table 3.

Table 3 - Annual requirementof nitrogen for the potential yield

Potential yield Requirement of nitrogen
(kg made tea per ha per year) (kg N per ha per year)
Less than 900 90
900-1300 140
1300-1500 160
1500-1700 180
1700-1900 200
1900-2000 220
2000-2500 270
2500-3000 320
3000-3500 360
Above 3500 400

The quantity of nitrogen to be applied in the respective years is therefore:

1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th
12months 12 months 12 months 12months 12months
Potential yield 1037 2140 2090 1708 926
N to be
applied
(kg per 140 270 270 200 140
ha per year)

Once the quantity of nitrogen per ha per year is determined for each field, the
quantity per application is calculated according to the number of applications that is
practically possible. The number of applications should be determined on the basis
of the agro-climatic conditions, as well as on the cropping pattern of the relevant
region.

Quantity of nutrients, basal mixture and urea, application frequencies and
dosages

The quantities of nutrients required, inclusive of the basal mixture and urea, and
the applicable frequencies and dosages corresponding to the potential yield
category for seedling and VP teas, are given in Tables 4 and 5.

Foliar and other ground fertiliser applications

Foliar applications of fertiliser for mature tea should be made with knapsack
sprayers.

Zinc sulphate

Zinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 6 and 11 kg per ha per year, for fields
yielding less than, and above, 2000 made tea kg per ha per year, respectively.
This should be done in four applications, i.e. 1.5 and 2.75 kg in 400 | of water per
ha per application. Zinc sulphate should be applied within 7 — 14 days after ground
fertiliser application.

Other nutrients

If deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) are observed, apply 2 to 4%
of urea. Apply 8 to 16 kg of urea per ha in 400 | of water, as and when necessary.

If deficiency symptoms of manganese (interveinal chlorosis and reddish brown
necrotic spots on leaf blade) are observed, test the soil pH. If it is above 5.5,
apply 2% manganese sulphate until symptoms disappear, preferably at 3 to 4
week intervals. In addition, withhold the scheduled application of dolomite.

Epsom salt and kieserite for correcting magnesium deficiency

When magnesium deficiency symptoms are observed, spray commercial Epsom
salt initially, at the rate of 48 kg per ha per year in four applications, at intervals
of three months.

Commercial Epsom salt, zinc sulphate and urea can be mixed together and
applied as a single foliar spray, when required. The quantity of urea and Epsom
salt could be adjusted depending on the severity of deficiency symptoms.
However, do not exceed 5% total salt concentration in the final spray solution.

(N.B. Zinc sulphate and Epsom salt are both salts.)
After application of the above, test the soil for Mg content. If it is below the critical

level (60 ppm), apply kieserite at the rate of 125 kg per ha per year by mixing
with basal NPK mixture or with urea in situ.

Note: 1. For fields yielding below 2000 kg per ha per year, the nitrogen level may be reduced
proportionately.
2. The quantity per application may be adjusted to suit the seasonal variation in yield as
well as age from pruning.
3. Where the bulk is large, the number of applications may be increased.
4. Urea could be bulked with the basal mixture.

3.4.4 Soil application of boron

When symptoms of boron deficiency are observed in shade trees, borate (borax)
is recommended at the rate of 4.5 kg per ha per year. Borate should be mixed
with basal NPK mixture or urea in situ.

3.4.5 Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects

Sulphate of potash is recommended for mature tea, to be applied prior to an
anticipated drought and in areas that are prone to frequent drought damage.

A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 8 kg in 400 | of water) is recommended
at fortnightly intervals, commencing at least a month prior to the onset of the dry
period. Spray immediately after harvesting to ensure proper deposition on the
mature foliage. Urea (2%) may be included in the spray solution to increase the
efficiency of potassium absorption.

Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.
