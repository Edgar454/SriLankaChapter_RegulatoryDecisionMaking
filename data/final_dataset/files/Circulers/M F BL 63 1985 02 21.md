# Circular No : NF/ BL/63

Sri Tea Commissioner

Lanka Tea Board, Division,

P.0. Box 363,

Colombo

21st February 1985.

Dear Sir/Hadau,

# Sale of Fannings

I refer you to my Circular letter No: MF/ BL.59 of 10th October, 1983.

It is observed that some factories have invoiced and dispatched "BM Fannings" to the Colombo Auctions declaring it in the monthly Production TC.5 Return under cage 16 which refers to refuge tea.

As intimated by my above mentioned Circular letter, please note that "BM Fannings" must be treated as a grade of tea permitted for sale at the Auctions. Therefore in future you should enter all such despatching of "BM Fannings" under item 12 cage 7 of the monthly TC.5 return.

It is also observed that some factories still do not perfect the TC.5 monthly return correctly as required by my Circular letters No MF/TP.6 of 18th July 1980 and 29th September 1980.

Hence you are hereby requested once again to ensure that all the cages in this return are filled up properly.

Your faithfully,

Sgd/- G.A. de Silva

Tea Commissioner.
