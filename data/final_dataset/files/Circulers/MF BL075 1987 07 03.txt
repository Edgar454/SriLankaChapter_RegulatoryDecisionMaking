Payment of a Reasonable Price for Green Leaf
purchased by Tea Factories
Your kind attention is dram to my Circular Letter Ho tF/BL.74
dated 10th April, 1987, regarding the calculation of the Heasonable Price

payable for Green Tea Leaf. *

2e As pex above Circular Letter, a mmufacturer is entitled to an
incentive poyment of: 50% of the excess when a factory realises a Netti
Sale Average Pxrice ovér and above the elevational average during any

39 __ The, olevational avernge is calculated based on the quantity of
teas actually gold nt. the. Auctions(quantity less samples) and the Nett
proceeds _Gess Advaiorem ‘Sales Tax). Therefore, please note that in
calculating the monthly factory Nett Sale Average to detexmine the
incentive entitlement, you should divide the Nett Sale Proceeds by the
quantity actually sold at the Auctions, i.e. less samples as in the case
of calculating the clevztionel average. ,

Yours faithfully,

Sgde. ReLbe Weerasckera
