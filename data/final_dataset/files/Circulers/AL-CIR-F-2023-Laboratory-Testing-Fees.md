# TQALL CUSTOMERS OF THE ANALYTICAL LABORATORY

Sirs,

# CHARGES FOR TESTING OF TEA SAMPLES AT THE ANALYTICAL LABORATORY OF SRI LANKA TEA BOARD

This circular supersedes Tea Board Circular No. OR/1/87 issued on 01st September, 2011.

This refers to section III of our Circular No. OR/1/87 dated 06th August 2010 addressed to all registered Exporters of Tea, Importers of Tea, Packers of Tea and Warehouse Owners of Tea under the caption Levy of Fees & Charges for Board's Services.

It is observed that tea samples forwarded to the Laboratory for analysis, by most of the customers are adopted their own methods and therefore the Analytical Laboratory is not in order to streamline the required analysis and issue test certificates due to lack of information.
