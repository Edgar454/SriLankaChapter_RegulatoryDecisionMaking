# GUIDELINES ON LAND SUITABILITY CLASSIFICATION FOR TEA

The selection of land according to its suitability has become increasingly important in making the best use of available land for tea cultivation: It is not appropriate for a single set of norms to be established for all tea-growing areas, since this will not take into account regional differences caused by variations in elevation and climate, which are likely to exert a strong influence on land suitability.

The term "land" includes many attributes such as climate, topography, soil and its genesis, vegetation, the presence of soil microorganisms and the effects of human activity. Land can be classified according to its agricultural suitability. Performance limitations of land intended for tea-growing can be determined by its physical, chemical and biological features.

Land classification can simplify management and decision-making on new planting, replanting, infilling, diversification and conservation of tea lands. It also helps to assess the long-term production trends and investment needs for enhanced productivity.

There are many factors that determine land suitability for tea. The most important factors are climate, slope, soil depth, surface rockiness and gravel content. Certain of these factors could be limiting factors. A simplified land suitability classification for tea can be based on limitations imposed by these factors and their interactions (Tables 1a and 1b):

|Climate (agro-ecological region)|Limiting Factor|Degree of Limitation|Slope (%)|Soil Depth (cm)|Surface Rockiness (%)|Gravel (Vol % in 50cm)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Regions above 900 m elevation|WU 23 IU 23|None|0 - 25|&gt;90|0 - 10|0 - 10|
| |IU1|Moderate|25 - 70|70 - 90|10 - 20|10 - 50|
| |All other up country regions|Severe|&gt;70|&lt;70|&gt;20|&gt;50|
|Regions between 300 - 900 m elevation|WM 3|None|0 - 25|&gt;90|0 - 10|0 - 10|
| |WM 2 & IM 2|Moderate|25 - 55|70 - 90|10 - 20|10 - 50|
| |All other mid country regions|Severe|&gt;55|&lt;70|&gt;20|&gt;50|
|Regions below 300 m elevation|WL 2|None|0 - 25|790|0 - 10|0 - 10|
| |All other low country regions|Moderate|25 - 70|70 - 90|10 - 20|10 - 50|
| | |Severe|770|&lt;70|&gt;20|&gt;50|
# Table 1b. Criteria for classifying lands according to their suitability for tea

|Moderate limitations|Climate|Slope|Soil depth|Surface rockiness|Gravel|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Climate|Class 2|Class 3|Class 4|Class 3|Class 3|
|Slope|3|2|4|3|3|
|Soil depth|4| |2|3| |
|Surface rockiness| |3|2|3| |
|Gravel|3|3|4|3|2|

The degree of limitation increases progressively from Class 1 to Class 4 (Table 2).

Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 are considered suitable for tea growing while Class 4 is considered unsuitable.

# Table 2. Land suitability classification based on limitations

|Suitability Class|Degree of Limitation|Suitability|
|---|---|---|
|Class 1|No significant limitation|Highly suitable|
|Class 2|Moderate single limitation|Suitable|
|Class 3|Moderate, dual limitations|Moderately suitable|
|Class 4|One or more severe limitations, strongly interacting dual limitations or multiple moderate limitations|Unsuitable|

(This classification is a modification of that in the paper by K A de Alwis, L H Fernando, S E Jayasooriya, S Kulasegaram, M B A Perera, S Sandanam, S Sivasubramaniam and D T Wettasinghe, 1980: "A simplified land suitability classification for tea" in Tea Quarterly 49 (2) 5-12, Tea Research Institute, Talawakelle)

# Methodology for Assessing the Limiting Factors

1. The slope of the land is measured using a clinometer.
2. The surface rockiness of the land is estimated by measuring the extent covered by rocks and boulders in the total land area.
3. The soil depth is measured by digging at random a minimum of 12 pits per ha to a depth of 1 m (Figure 1).
# Figure 1. Vertical cross section of a soil pit

The gravel content is measured by passing soil through a 2 mm mesh, or visually.
