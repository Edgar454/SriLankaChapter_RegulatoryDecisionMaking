# FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NURSERY TEA

January 1996 on the use of fertiliser for nursery tea plants: This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No: 01/96.

# 1.0 Introduction

Two nursery mixtures, viz. T65 MAP (containing mono-ammonium phosphate) and T65 DAP (containing di-ammonium phosphate), are recommended differing only in the source of phosphate. The option to have two P fertiliser sources is to allow the grower to use either source depending on its availability in the market. When both mixtures are available, T65 MAP is preferred as it is easier to handle because it dissolves faster.

# 1.1 Composition of nursery mixtures

# 1.1.1 T65 MAP

|15 parts|Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)|
|---|---|
|20 parts|Mono-ammonium phosphate (20% N and 35% P2O5)|
|15 parts|Sulphate of potash (48% K2O)|
|15 parts|Epsom salt (16% MgO)|
|65 parts|65 parts|

The mixture contains approximately 10.9% N, 10.8% P2O5, 11.1% K2O and 3.7% MgO.

# 1.1.2 T65 DAP

|20 parts|Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)|
|---|---|
|15 parts|Di-ammonium phosphate (18% N, 46% P2O5)|
|15 parts|Sulphate of potash (48% K2O)|
|15 parts|Epsom salt (16% MgO)|
|65 parts|65 parts|

The mixture contains approximately 10.5% N, 10.6% P2O5, 11.1% K2O and 3.7% MgO.

# 1.2 Method, dosage and frequency of application

# 1.21

In view of the limited solubility of Di-ammonium phosphate in the T85 DAP mixture, the fertiliser should be well ground and made into a paste prior to dissolving it in the required quantity of water. The fertilizer mixture should be applied using watering cans.

# 1.22

Commencing from the time of rooting (approximately 2 to 3 months after planting of cuttings), apply 35 g of T65 MAP or T65 DAP in 5 liters of water per sq. m. at fortnightly intervals (1 sq. m. would hold approximately 120 nursery plants).
# 1.2.3 Growth Progresses

(approximately 5 to 6 months after planting of cuttings): Increase the dosage to 70 g in 5 liters of water per sq. m. at fortnightly intervals as

# 1.2.4

Following each application, wash the foliage with clean water, to avoid scorch of leaves.

# 1.3 Estimation of T65 Requirements

At the above rates of application, the quantity of T65 MAP or T65 DAP required to raise 10,000 plants is estimated to be 60 to 90 kg, depending on the length of the nursery period in different regions. An approximate estimate of the quantity of the mixture required to raise 10,000 plants for low, mid- and up country is given below:

|Length of nursery period (months)|Quantity (kg)| |
|---|---|---|
|Low country|8 to 10|60 to 80|
|Mid-country|8 to 10|60 to 80|
|Up country|10 to 12|80 to 90|

# 1.4 Foliar Application of Zinc Sulphate

Foliar application of zinc sulphate is recommended to induce bud break and activate the growth of nursery plants.

# 1.4.1 Dosage and Frequency of Application

About a week after the first application of T65, spray 14 g of zinc sulphate in 4.5 liters of water to wet approximately 4500 plants, using knapsack sprayers: Repeat application at 4 to 6 weeks intervals, up to a maximum of 4 applications.
