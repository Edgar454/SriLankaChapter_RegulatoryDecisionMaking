# TRI ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.PU 2

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 02/24

# CHEMICAL CONTROL OF DISEASES

This Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PU2 Serial No. 02/23 issued in March 2023 and previous related circulars and links with Circular Nos. DMI, DM2, DM3, DM4, DMS, DM6 & DM7.

# 1. Introduction

For disease management in tea, an integrated approach inclusive of cultural, biological and chemical methods is recommended as specified in Advisory Circulars DM1 - DM7.

Two fundamental groups of fungicides are used to control tea diseases. They are either contact or systemic. Contact fungicides can kill a pathogen (fungus) only upon contact and are not absorbed into plant tissues. Systemic fungicides, on the other hand, have the ability to be absorbed into plant tissues and therefore may leave behind residues for a longer period with better controllability. This can become counterproductive when it comes to residues in the final product (made tea). Therefore, this makes it necessary to take all the precautions in resorting to control diseases using systemic fungicides. It is very important to use only the recommended fungicides as per TRI guidelines following the required Pre Harvest Interval (PHI):
