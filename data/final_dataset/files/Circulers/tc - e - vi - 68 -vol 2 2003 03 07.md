Sirs,

Importation of Orthodox Teas under the Tariff Regime

by the Ministry of Plantation Industries and the Sri Lanka Tea Board it was agreed that on the recommendation of the Regulatory Review Task Force, which have been approved, importation of Orthodox teas from other origins to Sri Lanka will be allowed under a very closed monitoring mechanism:

1. Teas can be imported to Sri Lanka on payment of the prevailing Import Tariff (2591999) provided the quality of teas according to the Customs Tariff Guide:
2. - (a) are above the minimum quality standard ISO 3720 for black tea;
- (b) are free of any chemical, biological or any other contamination, pesticides or any other pesticide residues;
- (c) are free of banned off-grades and dust.

The procedure to be adopted for the scheme for importation of orthodox teas under tariff regime from other origins is as follows:
