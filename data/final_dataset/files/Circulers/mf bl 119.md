Dear Sir,

# DELAY IN FURNISHING MONTHLY PRODUCTION RETURNS ON FORM TC 5

It has been observed that the furnishing of the above return has been delayed by Registered Manufacturers in several instances. This delay results in a serious setback on the total production figures furnished by this Division to the Central Bank and other State Agencies for national planning.

Your attention is also drawn to the fact that it is obligatory on the part of a manufacturer in terms of Section 11 of the Tea Control Act No. 51 of 1957 to furnish the returns before the fifth day of the following month. Therefore, any delays hereafter in furnishing the returns on the due dates will be viewed seriously and punitive action taken against such manufacturers. Please also note that in future subsidy payments will not be paid to the factory owners who have failed to forward the monthly production returns on due dates.

Your cooperation and assistance in this regard will be very much appreciated.

Yours faithfully,

M. S. Jayasinghe

Director General / Tea Commissioner
