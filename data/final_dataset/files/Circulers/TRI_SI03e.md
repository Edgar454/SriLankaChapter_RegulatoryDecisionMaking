# WIND AND SHELTER BELTS IN TEA

# Objectives

(This cancels &hc Circular No.0-2 - Serial No. 6/90, issued in October 1990)

In wind swept areas, it is advisable to establish shelter belts well before the planting of young tea. The full blast of the wind during the months of heavy blowing could result in:

- loss of crop in mature tea
- damage to leaf
- poor establishment of new clearings (arising from loosening of young plants and consequent bark damage at the soil level)

# Region-specific species

# 2.1 Up-country

A mixed stand of Grevillea robusta and Hakea saligna or Acacia spp. is recommended. They should be planted at right angles towards the direction of wind.

# 2.2 Mid-country

A mixed stand of Grevillea and Acacia spp. is recommended.

# 2.3 Spacing for Grevillea robusta

Grevillea robusta could be spaced 3.6 m (12 ft) apart in the row. On either side of Grevillea, Hakea saligna or Acacia spp. could be planted at a spacing of 1.2 - 1.8 m (4-6 ft). Alternatively, rows of Hakea or Acacia alone could be grown as wind belts at a spacing of 1.2 - 1.8 m (4-6 ft).

# 2.4 Low-country

A mixed stand of Fragrea fragrans and Gliricidia sepium is recommended for wind belts. Fragrea fragrans could be spaced 3.6 - 4.5 m (12-15 ft) along the row while Gliricidia sepium could be planted on either side of Fragrea at a spacing of 1.2 - 1.5 m (4-6 ft).

# 3. Spacing

Depending on the intensity of blowing of the wind, the ideal spacing should be ten times the height of the wind belt. The spacing between rows of wind belts could be 45 - 60 m (150-200 ft). On hillcrest, wind belts consist of double rows planted on a triangular arrangement as recommended above (para 2.3 and 2.4) for specific species.

# 4. Tea as wind belt

In case wind belts are not established, tea itself could be established as a wind belt by allowing it to grow freely. However, the distance should be closer than 45 m.
