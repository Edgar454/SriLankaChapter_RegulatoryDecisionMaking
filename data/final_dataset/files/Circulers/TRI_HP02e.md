# Guidelines on Plucking

# Introduction

Picking of young tea shoots having two to three leaves and soft dormant shoots (banjhi) is known as plucking: Plucking is the most labour intensive field operation in tea plantations. Hence, the profitability of tea plantations depends to a large extent on the harvesting policies. Well-balanced plucking policy enhances the yield and optimises the labour use without affecting the quality of made tea.

# Shoot growth and shoot generations

The production and storing of food materials take place in all growing shoots and growth of a bush depends on such food materials. Plucking removes a greater part of shoots that are in the process of production. The degree of removal of growing shoots can affect the growth and yield of a tea bush. In order to optimise the shoot growth, it is very essential to understand the functions or the importance of different growing stages of a tea shoot:

- Bud
- Normal Leaves
- Fish Leaf
- Scale Leaves
- Janam Leaf
- Mother Leaf

Tea Shoot
# Growth of shoots

After plucking, shoot growth starts from the axillary buds just below the point of plucking. There is potential for a number of axillary buds to commence growth after apical growth is interrupted by plucking. But the first axillary bud immediately below the plucking point usually grows first.

Initially, two small appendages known as scale leaves, which cover the bud, open. They generally fall off a few days after opening out. Then another one or two medium sized, unserrated, blunt leaves are unfolded above these scale leaves. The smaller one immediately above the scale leaves is termed janam leaf and the other one is called the fish leaf. Then the bud starts to produce normal leaves which are commonly included in the harvest.

After unfurling 4-5 leaves, the terminal bud becomes inactive and passes through a dormant (resting) period known as banjhi or wangi. The growth pattern having alternate active and dormant growing phases is termed as periodicity of growth.

Initiation of the axillary bud growth is rather slow. It enters into a fast growing period after unfurling the janam/fish leaf. This is generally known as the linear phase of growth, reaching the harvestable size; i.e., with 2-3 flush leaves. Shoot weight approximately doubles at the opening of each extra leaf on a shoot.

# Shoot generations

There are a number of shoots of different growth stages in a tea bush: i.e., growing buds, bud and scale leaves; bud and fish leaf; etc. A group of shoots of the same growth stage or age is called a generation. The generations are formed as a result of variation in shoot growth and frequent harvesting. Continuous plucking is possible as there are a large number of shoots belonging to different generations in a tea bush. The number of generations usually increases with shortening of the plucking round. Increase in shoot generations helps to increase the shoot population density, which is the major yield component.

Growing buds and immature shoots (arimbus) on a plucking table are considered major sites for storing carbohydrates (sink) produced by mature leaves (source) essential to ensure that the immature shoots are left on the bush after plucking.
# Leaf standard (Plucking standard)

This refers to the composition of standard flush leaf of the harvested crop.

Standard (acceptable) flush leaf means:

- Shoots with two tender leaves & bud
- Immature dormant shoots
- Shoots with three tender leaves & bud

Immature shoots and coarse leaf are unacceptable.

# Percentage of Standard Lush Leaf Standard

|Fine Plucking|More than 75%|
|---|---|
| |60-75%|
|Coarse Plucking| |
|Medium Plucking| |
| |Less than 60%|

Plucking coarse leaves will lead to drop in the quality of made tea.

# Plucking style (Severity of plucking)

This refers to the point at which a shoot is plucked. The appropriate plucking style should be selected depending on the prevailing weather pattern, bush vigour and labour availability.

A well-planned plucking policy with a combination of light and hard plucking during different seasons, by maintaining a good canopy depth, should be carried out.

# Severity of plucking

|Plucking Style|Point of Plucking|Type of leaves left on the bush|
|---|---|---|
|Light Plucking or Single leaf plucking or Mother leaf plucking|Just above the first mature leaf|One mature leaf; fish leaf & scale leaves|
|Hard Plucking or Fish leaf plucking|Just above the fish leaf|Fish leaf & scale leaves|
# Plucking Round

# Frequency of Plucking

Plucking round is the number of days between successive plucking. An ideal plucking round is the number of days taken between successive openings of leaves on a shoot. This period is called leaf period or phyllochron.

Plucking rounds become shorter during wet weather while it is extended during dry weather. Therefore, the plucking rounds should also be determined accordingly. Maintaining a proper plucking round that matches the rate of shoot growth helps to increase the yield and to minimize a drop in the quality of made tea.

Haphazard extended plucking rounds may not only lower the made tea quality, but also reduce the yield. Plucking rounds and the plucking standards are independent factors. Extended rounds may influence the plucking standards due to high percentage of over-mature shoots.

# Plucking and Vigour of the Bush

The tea leaf attains the highest photosynthetic activity when they reach half their final size. It remains at the maximum for about 6 months from full expansion. Usually, the life span of a tea leaf is about 18 months. This shows that the older leaves do not contribute to the production because production plucking to a mother leaf for about 6 months per year is required.

Therefore, addition of new foliage on the canopy by continuous mother leaf plucking leads to the unnecessary rise in the plucking table. Maintenance of a thick canopy (more than 25 cm) is not required, as leaves at the bottom layers of the canopy do not receive sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis. Adoption of mother leaf plucking is necessary to build up adequate leaf canopy.

Depth of maintenance foliage is less in young tea and in pruned tea. Hence, fish leaf plucking could be done during the cropping months, while mother leaf plucking during the balance periods is recommended. Hard plucking will give a higher yield initially, but continuous hard plucking will result in debilitation of the bush and an increase in the formation of feet condition.

Continuous hard plucking or light plucking systems will bring about low productivity of the bush. It is therefore important to adopt mixture depending on the prevailing weather condition in the area, the age from pruning and bringing into bearing practices.

# Mechanical Harvesting

Mechanical harvesting should be sought if the hand plucking is impractical due to the scarcity of labour. Under such conditions, TRI Selective Tea Harvester could be used.
# Other important aspects of plucking

1. Plucking table should be even and it should follow the slope of the land. This should be initiated from the time of pruning/tipping and continued with the bush creep.
2. Removal of banji and crows-feet should be a routine practice.
3. Immature shoots (armbus) must be left unplucked to be taken at the next round as heavier units.
4. Coarse leaves and stalks should be removed in the field to maintain a better leaf standard and a plucking table.
5. Shoots on side branches and hollows on the plucking table should be left unplucked until they cover the open spaces.
6. Pluckers should be instructed not to ram the flush into their baskets.
7. Pluckers should be instructed not to retain an excessive number of plucked shoots in their hands.
8. Plucking on the rested bushes and on the 'lungs' of pruned bushes should be avoided.
9. Transporting should be minimized: shoots possible damages to plucked at the point of weighing, bulking and.
10. Education of pluckers and careful supervision on plucking will ensure the quality of made tea.
