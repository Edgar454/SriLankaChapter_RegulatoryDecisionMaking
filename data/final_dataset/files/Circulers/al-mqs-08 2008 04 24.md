# SRI LANKA TEA BOARD

# Circular No.: AL/MQS/08

24th April 2008.

# TO ALL REGISTERED MANUFACTURERS and EXPORTERS OF TEA

Dear Sirs,

Sri Lanka Tea Board Standards/ Guidelines for Tea (Sri Lanka Tea Board Law No.14 of 1975) mandates the Sri Lanka Tea Board as the monitoring authority of quality/ standard of teas exported globally. This matter has been re-emphasized as a result of a number of complaints from buying countries received about contaminants and adulterants of tea exported from Sri Lanka. As a protective measure, the Tea Board has now finalized and implements Standards and Guidelines for "Sri Lanka Origin Teas" and "Other Origin Teas" which are imported for re-export purposes. The Minimum Quality Standard will cover ISO 3720 for Black Tea and this standard is mandatory at the point of export of any teas.

# 02.

The Guidelines pertaining to the Maximum Residue Limits of Pesticides, Microbial contaminants and extraneous matters indicated in the Annexure - A should be taken as guidelines for compliance by all registered manufacturers and exporters of tea.

# 03.

The standards indicated in the Annexure - B should be strictly applicable for all other origin teas at the point of importation and exportation. Hence non-conformity of such standards in any other origin teas will be treated as grounds for rejection of import / re-export.

# 04.

The above Guidelines and Standards are implemented with effect from 01st May 2008.
