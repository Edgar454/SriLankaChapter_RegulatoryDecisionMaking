# Manufacture of Tea

Your attention is drawn to Circular Letter Mo.M/BL.67 dated 31st December 1985.

Despite attempts to improve, it is observed that the net quality of teas manufactured by improving the standard of processing; January 1986 rate in your factory average price for the month of the Colombo Auctions has been below the relevant elevational average.

Hence, with the urge to stress again that unless remedial action of teas produced and higher price is initiated, the standard reluctantly compelled will take appropriate action as Remedial necessary under the provisions of the Tea Control Act.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours faithfully,

Signed - G. de Silva,
