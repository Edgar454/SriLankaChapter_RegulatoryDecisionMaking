# Fertilizer Recommendation for Mature Tea in Small Holdings

This circular replaces Interim Circular No. SP 10, Serial No: 01/10, issued in August 2010.

The soil organic matter content in low and mid country and Uva tea growing regions are generally low and therefore, the potential of retaining plant nutrients in these soils is also relatively low. This leads to poor use efficiency of soil applied fertilizers in these regions. Recent assessments done in small holder lands in these regions revealed that soil magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S) levels are also significantly low.

Applications of mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as Urea, Eppawela rock phosphate and Muriate of potash respectively, are recommended for mature tea fields in 2 to 5 splits per annum. The annual requirement of N is based on the potential yield recommended quantity of dolomite (MgCO3CaCO3) for pH correction at the time of pruning: The recommended quantity of dolomite is to be based on soil pH level in the latter part of the last year of cycle. Dolomite should comply with the specifications given in the TRI Advisory Circular SP3.

Even though dolomite is applied, low nutrient retention capacities of soils may not make Mg available for plants throughout the pruning cycle. Furthermore, Mg deficiency could also be induced due to suppression of its uptake by the applications of higher rates of N and K containing fertilizers. These circumstances invariably lead to lack of Mg in soil and affecting healthy plant growth.

In view of above observations, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 were formulated as strategic interventions to improve soil fertility status in the tea small holdings. The suitability of new mixtures were tested in 26 small holder lands along with the other fertilizer mixtures previously recommended by the TRI, covering different Agro-ecological regions in major tea growing areas.

Based on the outcomes of adaptive trials, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 are recommended for small holdings in all the tea growing regions in addition to previously recommended fertilizer mixtures for mature VP tea fields in different tea growing regions viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VPIUM 910 and VPIUM 1020 for mid & up country and VPIUva 945 and VPIUva 1055 for the Uva region.

|Fertilizer Mixtures|Tea Growing Regions|
|---|---|
|U834|All Regions|
|UT752|All Regions|
|VPILC 880|Low Country|
|VPILC 1075|Low Country|
|VPIUM 910|Mid & Up Country|
|VPIUM 1020|Mid & Up Country|
|VPIUva 945|Uva Region|
|VPIUva 1055|Uva Region|
Growers may select the mixtures to be used primarily based on the soil nutrient status, yield or crop responses. It is advisable to use either UT 752 mixture with 100 kg of dolomite per acre per annum or U 834 mixture if soil Mg and/or S levels are below 60 and 40 milligrams per kilogram (ppm) respectively in all the tea growing regions. However, if soil Mg level is above 60 ppm and S level above 40 ppm, it is appropriate to use regional specific mixtures viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VPMUM 1020 for mid and up country and VPUva 945 and VPMUva 1055 for Uva region.

Considering lower plant density, individual bush manuring is strongly recommended for the fields yielding less than 130 kg green leaf/lac/month:

Since dolomite is recommended at the rate of 100 kg/lac/yr in one or two applications, as applied regularly, dolomite should be broadcast at a source of Mg when UT752 mixture is least four weeks prior to ground fertilizer applications.

In addition to ground fertilizer application, it is essential to apply foliar spray of Zinc sulphate ideally within 10-14 days after each ground fertilizer application in order to induce bud break:

Factors such as weather conditions, soil properties and moisture status etc., affect the efficiency of applied fertilizer. It is essential to apply fertilizers when the soil is moist.
improves retention of moisture and applied nutrients in soil. In addition, adoption of soil

Adding organic matter in the form of compost and green manure etc. to tea fields
