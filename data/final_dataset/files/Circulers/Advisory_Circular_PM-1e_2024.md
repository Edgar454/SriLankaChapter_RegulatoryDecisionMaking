# SAMPLING FOR SHOT-HOLE BORER ASSESSMENT

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PM 1 Serial No. 1/03 issued in February 2003 and related previous Advisory Circulars and links with Advisory Circular PU 4 and PM 2)

It is essential to estimate the infestation level of Shot-hole borer (SHB) (Xyleborus fornicatus Eichh:), synonym: Euwallacea fornicatus when tea fields are infested with SHB, before deciding on the appropriate control measures.

# 1. When to Sample

Immature fields: Sampling should be carried out just prior to first formative prune.

Mature fields: Sampling should be carried out in the final year of the pruning cycle.

# 2. How to Sample

Sampling should be carried out in one hectare block separately: Blocks could be demarcated by natural boundaries such as roads, paths, ravines, drains, shade trees etc., wherever possible (Figure 1).

|Block 1|Block 2|
|---|---|
|Block 6|Block 7|
|Block 3|Block 5|

Figure 1: Division of a Field into Blocks for sampling comprise 100 standard units per ha; taking not more than one unit per bush: If there is more than one cultivar in a given field each cultivar should be assessed separately:

Having selected a bush at random, remove a primary branch arising from the pruned stem that would give a piece of stem 10 cm in length. This piece of stem is referred to as a 'standard unit'. The selection of the branches should be at random and no attempt be made to select only those showing signs of galleries:

# 3. Standard Units
# Estimation of Infestation

The incidence of gallery making; one should bear in mind that the number of galleries per sample unit is immaterial. The unit that has one or more galleries is considered as a single infested unit. If there is more than one cultivar in a given field each cultivar should be assessed separately.

# Figure 2: The number of units with galleries that is counted

|A unit with no galleries (not galleried)|A unit with one gallery (galleried)|
|---|---|
|A unit with two galleries (galleried)|A unit with three galleries (galleried)|

Number of galleried units = 3

# 4. Estimation of Infestation

The standard units should be split open and examined for the presence of galleries: The percentage incidence (as percentage gallery making) of gallery making (G%) is calculated as follows:

G% = (No_of_galleried units / Total no_ of units sampled) X 100

# 5. Recommendations

|% Gallery making (G%)|Degree of infestation|Control measures|
|---|---|---|
|0 - 25%|Light|Not necessary|
|26 - 50%|Moderate|Necessary|
|51 - 100%|Heavy|Compulsory|

Please refer Advisory Circular PU 4 and PM 2 to implement the control measures appropriate to the field based on above recommendations.
