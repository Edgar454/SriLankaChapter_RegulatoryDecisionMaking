# 1. Introduction

Diseases, insect, mite and nematode pests and weeds occur in tea, in different stages of the crop, and at different times of the year. Therefore an integrated approach (Integrated Pest Management: IPM) is recommended for efficient and timely management of pests in tea, which consists of various agronomic, cultural, biological and chemical strategies in a rational and environmentally friendly manner: Rational use of fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, and weedicides is part of integrated management of diseases; insects, mites, nematodes and weeds respectively.

In parallel, it is necessary to strengthen biological systems and improve cultural practices in order to promote the build-up of tolerance in plant and biological-control organisms in the environment; and to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests, diseases and weeds in tea fields. Also, use of tea cultivars resistant / tolerant to the different diseases and pests is the prime component in the IPM:

As tea is a food commodity for human consumption, there is a growing concern among health-conscious consumers on pesticide residues that may be present in tea. Therefore, it is advisable to use pesticides in tea fields carefully, in order to minimize the residues in made tea, effects on workers and non-target organisms in the eco-system: Moreover; the cost-effectiveness and the social acceptance of pesticide usage also have to be considered for the sustainability of the tea industry:

The chemicals and their use in tea as Plant Protection Products (PPPs) are subjected to change periodically to meet the requirements of consumers, social and environmental acceptance etc. It is extremely necessary to ensure that the pesticide residues in made tea at levels below the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) set for different pesticides by different countries.

When PPPs are applied to tea cultivations, it is necessary to strictly adhere to specific Pre-Harvest Intervals (PHI) and bulk green leaf from the sprayed and unsprayed fields or made tea at a ratio of keeping and monitoring on rational use of the PPPs are made mandatory for traceability and regulatory purposes: This would help dilute and minimize the pesticide residues in the made tea. Proper record keeping is essential.

# 2. List of Recommended PPPs

The active substances recommended for control of diseases, insects, mites and nematode pests and weeds in tea plantations by the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka, as at March, 2023 and respective MRLs of Japan and the EU are given in the Table 1.

Growers are advised to use only the PPPs listed in Table 1 and as per TRI recommendations given in Advisory Circulars PU 2, PU 3 and PU 4 for management of diseases, weeds and insect; mite and nematode pests respectively.
