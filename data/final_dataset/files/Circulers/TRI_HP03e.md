# CULTIVATION OF TEA SOILS FORKING

This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No. S 1, Serial No. 5/71

# 1. Introduction

The continuous growing of a single crop causes deterioration of soil physical properties. This may be at a maximum in a tea field with a poor bush density. The soil surface to harvest crop as well as to perform other cultural operations. This treading creates run-off of most of the rain falling on the surface. The entry of air through the surface pores is also restricted thereby, causing a deficit of oxygen that is most necessary for vigorous root growth. When infiltration of rainwater is low and run-off is high, the fertilizer applied will be washed away with the run-off water, thus causing wastage of costly fertilizer.

# 2. Method of Soil Cultivation

To break compaction and aerate the soil, the type of soil cultivation recommended is termed "forking". The objective of forking is to ensure deep cultivation of soil in a mild degree. Forking could be carried out in the inter-row spaces both in VP and Seedling tea. In the case of seedling fields which is planted up and down the slope, forking could be carried out in a staggered manner.

While forking, the soil is opened up, at the center of the inter-row space, without turning over the clod and with minimum of disturbance to the feeder roots. Deep forking is undertaken with a garden fork having 3-4 tines, 38-45 cm long, which is forced into the ground at a nearly vertical angle up to depth of 38-45 cm. The handle of the fork is pocket behind the tines. The fork is then withdrawn when the operation is called "plain forking". Well decomposed tea waste, manure, loppings and such other materials (compost, or else the ground litter, green materials) are pushed into the pocket created, in which case it is called "envelope forking". This operation is repeated at intervals of about 22-30 cm apart.

# 3. Forking in Relation to Weather

Forking during prolonged dry weather should be avoided. When forking is carried out in such dry periods, the soil surface is exposed to wind and sun resulting in increased evaporation of soil water. It is also advisable to avoid forking during heavy rains, as soils of unstable crumb structure tend to puddle very readily.
# 4. Frequency and Time of Forking

# 4.1 Frequency of Forking

It is recommended that forking be carried out only in mid-country, and once known to be clayey and compacted, the flexibility to fork once a cycle may be allowed.

# 4.2 Time of Forking

Though forking is normally done after pruning, the best time to undertake forking is when there is sufficient new foliage on the bush and adequate soil moisture, which would be around tipping time. Forking could also be spread over two intervals, when alternate rows are forked each time. The first round may be undertaken as described above, while the second round may be given mid-cycle, but at the latter time there would be insufficient space between two rows for comfortable worker movement.

# 5. Economics of Forking

The benefits of improving soil physical properties and water percolation into the soil through forking cannot always be calculated in physical terms, but it could be assumed to reflect in the yield. Recent research indicated that, over a 4-year cycle, forking can give a net incremental yield of about 20%, compared to the control. This analysis, whilst indicating the profitability of the operation of forking, should not be taken out of context and generalized. Research data is applicable only to the specific set of conditions (slope, soil, rainfall, and microclimate) operating in a given field yet could be taken to serve as an indicator of the economic advantages that could accrue through forking.
