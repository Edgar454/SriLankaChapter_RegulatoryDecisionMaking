# USE OF LION LOGO

The Lion Logo is a Trade Logo Mark owned by the Sri Lanka Tea Board. Any person who wishes to use the Lion Logo must obtain the franchise rights from the Director, Tea Promotion Bureau.

It has come to the notice of the Tea Board that certain manufacturers/exporters are using the Lion Logo on bulk packaging tea without approval - in chests or paper sacks. Please note that the use of the Lion Logo is permitted only on packaging containing caddies (i.e. packs, bags, etc).

Exporters are hereby requested to refrain from using the Lion Logo on bulk teas. General Customs is advised that any shipments of bulk tea with the Lion Logo will not be permitted after 1st November 1993.

Yours faithfully,
