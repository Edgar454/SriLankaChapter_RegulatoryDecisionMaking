PRUNING OFTEA
(This replaces theCircular No.HP1Serial No.3/01)
1.Objectives
Theobjectives ofpruning teaareto:
•maintain aconvenient height oftheplucking table foreasyharvesting,
•stimulate vegetative shoot growth forsustaining productivity,
•remove old,decayed, pest-infested anddiseased branches formaintaining ahealthy frame,
•effectively utilize thelandarea, andensure economic viability ofplantations.
2. Categorization offields
Inorder toembark onabalanced andsuccessful pruning programme, itisnecessary tocategorize
teafields according totheir potential yield. Thiswillreduce theriskofcrop losses andannual
crop fluctuations. Categorization offields should beupdated periodically, taking into
consideration thenewclearings under capital, coming intobearing under revenue. Please refer
Advisory Circular No.LU2onFieldcategorization intealands fordetails.
3. Methods ofpruning
Pruning should bedone withasharp knife andthecutpreferably, bemade slanted towards the
centre ofthebush. There arefourmajor styles ofpruning, asoutlined below viz.clean, rimlung
cut-across andrejuvenation pruning. Although rimlungpruning isthemost suitable method,
other styles alsocanbeadopted under special circumstances asgiven below.
3.1 Clean Pruning
Thisisahardpruning system bywhich allthebranches arecutlowataheight of25-40 cm(10-
16"). Clean pruning usually results inlateorpoor recovery duetotheabsence offoliage and
inadequate starch reserves tosupport budbreak andsubsequent growth ofshoots.
However, clean pruning may beadopted athigh elevations, provided thesoilandweather
conditions areconducive forgrowth andadequate starch reserves areavailable intheteabush
forbetter recovery after pruning.

3.2Rimlungpruning
Inrimlungpruning, about 3to4healthy branches areleftattheperiphery ofthebush atthe
time ofpruning. These lungbranches should have inallabout 200to300leaves perbush to
enable early recovery. Therecommended height ofpruning is40-55 cm(16-22").
3.3Cut-across pruning
Incut-across prune, thetopofthebush iscutlevelataheight ofabout 55-70 cm(22-28"). Inthis
typeofpruning, nocleaning upofolddebilitated branches ispossible andhence itcanleadto
poor frame development. With cut-across pruning, itispossible toobtain anearly crop.
Thereafter, thebushes willremain dormant forprolonged period. Old,debilitated ormarginal tea
fields thatareear-marked foruprooting ordiversification canbegiven acut-across pruning.
3.4Rejuvenation Pruning
Rejuvenation pruning isatypeofhardpruning carried outwhen thefoundation frame ofbushes
reaches anunproductive stage. Theheight ofpruning canvarydepending onthestatus ofthe
frame. Please refertothe'Advisory Circular' No.HP4onrejuvenation pruning fordetails.
3.5Skiffing
Skiffing isaslashing orleveling operation which smoothens theplucking surface andreduces its
height byafewcentimetres. Itcanbeusedtodelay arushcroportoextend thepruning cycle, if
theneed arises.
4.Length ofpruning cycle
Thelengths ofpruning cycle recommended fordifferent teagrowing regions are:
Region
Lowcountry
Mid-country (wetzone)
Mid-country (Intermediate zone) orUva
UpcountrySeedling
2years
3-4years
3-4years
3-4yearsVP
3years
4-5years
4-5years
4-5years
5.Time ofpruning
Pruning intheUpcountry, Mid-country (wetzone) andLowcountry regions could bedone during
ApriltoJune, after afewshowers from thesouth-west monsoon andwhen there isadequate soil
moisture. Forsome reason, ifpruning cannot bedone orcompleted during thisseason, those
fields could bepruned during September toOctober. However, highyielding fields should be
pruned during thesouth-west monsoon. Some areas inthelowcountry (Balangoda, Rakwana,
2
etc.), and inthemid-country (Matale, Upper Hewaheta, Udapussellawa regions etc.),
high-yielding teafields should bepruned during September toOctober withtheonset ofrains.
IntheUvaregions, high-yielding teafields should bepruned during October toJanuary which is
anassured season ofraininthisarea. Theremaining fields earmarked forpruning inthesame
region could bepruned during March toApril. Pruning ofafieldshould becompleted within the
shortest period oftime (within about 7days). Thisistofacilitate uniform recovery andto
complete postpruning practices intime.
Teafields should notbepruned immediately after harvesting therush crop andfollowing a
prolonged drought. These fields should berested atleastforabout 6weeks. Theperiod could be
extended inthecaseofpruning ofdebilitated bushes. Thisisextremely necessary forbuilding up
ofcarbohydrate reserves forearly andbetter recovery after pruning. Inorder toidentify fields to
berested before pruning, asimple iodine testonroots canbedone about 2-3months before
pruning.
6.Dryweather pruning
Pruning intodryweather isnotrecommended, because itmaycause sunscorch onbranches
leading towood rotandframe debilitation. Scorching alsoreduces thenumber ofnewshoots.
Dryweather pruning asameasure ofcontrolling blister blight isalsonotrecommended.
7.Bush sanitation
Thisinvolves theremoval andshaving offweak, diseased, dead orpest-infested stems and
branches torenovate thebush frame. Bush renovation should beundertaken from the1st
pruning onwards. Theindividual branches withextensive die-back, wood rot,canker andtermite
damage could bepruned lowwhile maintaining auniform height ofprune. Itispreferable to
apply arecommended wound dressing ontheprune cuts andshaved offwounds. Pruned
branches canbeprotected from sunscorch byplacing some oftheprunings overthebush for
about 3daysimmediately after pruning.
8.Mossing and Ferning
Moss andfernontheframes should becleaned manually orchemically using lime, soon after
pruning andwellbefore thecommencement ofbud-break. Hydrated limecanbesprayed onthe
frames attherateof125kgdissolved in1250 Lofwater perha.

9.Burying ofprunings
Inorder toenhance soilfertility, pruned branches should beretained inthefield asmulch or
buried inshallow trenches inthealternate inter-rows offlatorundulating tealands. Lopped
branches ofshade trees cutintopieces mayalsobeincorporated.
10.Removal oflung branches
Thelungs should beremoved selectively depending onthestage ofrecovery ofindividual bushes.
Thisshould tobestarted when themajority ofnewshoots have produced 3-4fullyopened
leaves. Removal oflungs tooearly ortoolateshould beavoided.
11.Tipping height
Shoots should betipped leaving 4to6leaves above theprune cut,depending onthepruning
height. Early tipping orplucking-in should beavoided, because itwillretard thickening of
branches which leads topoorframe development.
12.Fertilizer and dolomitic limestone application
Suspend application offertilizers 2-3months prior topruning. Resume application offertilizers
2-3months after pruning. Thiscould bedone atthetimeoftipping. Early application offertilizer
before tipping cancause leaf-scorch. Dolomitic limestone should beapplied based onsoilpH,
preferably afewweeks before pruning. Please refer Advisory Circular No.SP3onFertilizer
recommendations formature teafordetails.
13.Envelope forking
Envelope forking isbeneficial forsoilaeration androotgrowth. Itcould bedone atthetime of
tipping, once inacycle athighandmid-elevations, andonce intwocycles atlowelevations.
