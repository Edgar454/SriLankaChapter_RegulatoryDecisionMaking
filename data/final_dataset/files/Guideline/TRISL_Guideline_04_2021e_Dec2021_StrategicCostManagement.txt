Issued in:  December 2021       Guideline No: 0 4/2021 
 
Interim Guideline s on Strategic C ost Component Management in Tea  Cultivation with 
Special Reference to Rational Use of Plant Nutrients  and Tea Manufacture  
 
1. Background/Rationale  
Ultimate objective of any enterprise is optimizing  the profit s and the same is true for the 
stakeholders in tea supply and value chain  as well.  The p rofit is defined as the difference 
between the sale price and cost of the product  (COP ). Therefore, it is imperative to maintain 
the cost components as minimum as possible and obtain high er price s to accrue  higher profit 
margin s. Ensuring the best quality of end-product and adding value  to them will also increase 
the Net Sale Average (NSA) of graded tea. 
 
With limited availability and higher input costs, it is necessary to identify appropriate 
strategies for the rational use of such inputs in order to manage cost s and minimiz e impacts on 
sustainable production .  
 
The purpose of th is interim guideline  is to advise  the growers  and producers on key  strategies  
to manag e cost components in tea cultivation and processing. However, it should be cautioned  
that the curtailment of inputs such as fertilizers  need not be continued as a routine practice as 
they adversely affect productivity.  
 
2. Strategic cost management in tea cultivati on 
2.1 Rational u se of plant nutrients for tea fields   
The costs of plant nutrients  and application s vary from 6  - 12% of total cost of production  
(COP) . Hence, r ational use of plant nutrients is important to maintain tea land s profit ably.  
 
 Do not curtail fertilizer inputs for tea nurser ies and immature tea (up to formative 
pruning)  in the use of T  65, and T  200 and T  750 mixtures respectively and continue as 
recommend ed (Refer Advisory Circulars SP1 and SP2)   
 An interim recommendation on a  fertilizer mixture containing Sulphate of Ammonia 
(SA), Eppawela Rock Phosphate (E RP) and Muriate of Potash (MOP)  formulated as 
T1240 is made  for the use in mature tea fields.  
 The composition and nutrient concentrations of T 1240 are given in  Table 1.

  Use nitrogen (N) rationally for mature tea based on the average yields as detailed in 
Tables 2 and 3  for corporate sector and small holdings respectively  so that every 100  kg 
of made tea  below and above the yield level of 1400 made tea kg per ha per year 
receives on average 08 kg and 10 kg of N respectively .

 Apply T1240 mixture 2, 3 and 4 times a year for tea fields yielding less than 800 kg, 
800-1400 kg and above 1400 kg of made tea per ha per year (<130, 130 -220 & >220 kg 
green leaf per ac per month)  respectively.  
 Apply fertilizer from plant to plant for tea fields yielding less than 800 kg of made tea 
per ha per year (<130 green leaf per ac per month)  
 Test soil pH regularly and correct soil acidity (optimum range of pH being 4.5 -5.5) by 
applying dol omite prior to chemical fertilizer application to improve nutrient 
availability and plant uptake as given in Table 4 as per the recommend ation s (Refer 
Advisory Circular SP3).  
 Use compost  to improv e nutrient use efficiency and soil pH buffering capacity . 
However , compost made  from  municipal waste is not permitted  due to possible 
contamination with heavy metals . 
 Apply compost preferably at the rate of 5 metric tons per ha per year (2 metric tons per 
acre per year) in low country and 2.5 metric tons per ha p er year (1 metric ton per acre 
per year) in up country, mid country and Uva regions or 20 metric tons  per hectare (8 
metric per acre) at the prune in low country and 10 metric tons per hectare  at the prune 
in up country , mid country and Uva region s depending on the availability . Wherever 
possible, incorporate compost into soil by envelope forking.

2.2 Adopt  shorter plucking r ounds  to improve  tea yield, leaf standard and quality of made tea  
2.3 Give priority and d eploy maximum workforce  for plucking  (harvesting)  
2.4 Use suitable machines for labour intensive operations such as plucking, pruning and 
weeding  
2.5 Adhere to  rest fields prior to  pruning and advocate correct length of pruning c ycle (3 year 
cycle for VP tea in low country and 4 -5 year cycle for VP tea in up  country , mid country 
and Uva regions) . Undue shortening of cycles will lead to more non -productive periods 
(recovery after pruning).  
2.6 Adopt  alternative worker deployment models  (AWDMs)  such as offering work to estate 
workers on contractual basis, cash plucking, block plucking, contract farming systems  
and out grower system  to overcome labour scarcity  and  improve  labour productivity .  
2.7 Monitor  key field operations  such as plucking, pruning, fertilizer application to ensure 
high worker productivity and quality of field operation s)  
2.8 Adhere to soil and moisture conservation and integrated fertility management strategies 
as per TRI guidelines to ensure minimize inpu t losses.  
2.9 Adhere to integrated approaches as per TRI guidelines on seasonal and perennial pest and 
disease incidences affecting yield and quality.  
2.10 Adhere to integrated weed management strategies as per TRI guidelines to ensure higher 
yield .  Consolidate ground cover  by infilling and planting of mana in vacant patches  to 
suppress weed growth.  
2.11 Improve productivity  of tea lands  by infilling of vacancies , replanting , timely 
management of pest and diseases,  and adoption of  other key good agricultural practices . 
2.12 Diversify t ea lands with poor soil conditions into appropriate use such as establishment of 
fuel-wood blocks and thatch banks /grass planting.   
 
3. Strategic cost management in tea manufacture  
3.1  Process only standard leaf with a view to reduc ing processing time and thereby reducing 
cost of worker and energy ; and minimize ware and tare of machinery  in tea factories.  4 
 3.2 Use suitable size dryer and required number of machiner ies only for optimiz ing 
performance and productivity  
3.3 Implement formal energy audits with TRI assistance and determine critical points in 
factory operations for corrective measures  
3.4 Strictly monitor and r educe energy consumption  by an appropriate e nergy (electrical and 
thermal) management plan. For exampl e, maintain required stock of cut, split and dried 
firewood and use it to generat e hot air for withering and drying processes.  
3.5 Implement GMPs (Good Manufacturing Practices); follow properly designed rolling 
programme and grading programme and control process parameters such as hygrometric 
difference in air for withering, dryer temperatures and airflow for withering and drying , 
and i ntroduce monitoring and controlling systems in tea manufacturing to ensure 
implementation of GMPs.  
3.6 Suitably re -siting  machinery and automate/conveyori se appropriately for smooth tea 
manufacture  
3.7 Avoid operating the factory under -capacity.  
3.8 Train factory staff and workers on all the aspect s in relation to  tea manufacture and 
factory operations to improve their perfo rmance/productivity  
3.9 Introduce proper record keeping  approach  for routine monitori ng of cost components
