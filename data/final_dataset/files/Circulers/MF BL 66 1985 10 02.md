# TO: ALL REGISTERED

Dear Sir,

# Payment of Reasonable Price for Green Leaf Purchased by Tea Factories

Reference to requested paragraph 3 of my circular letter No. MF{BL,64 of 17th June 1985 regarding the formula for calculation the reasonable price payable for green leaf.

The Sri Lanka Tea Board has not decided to revise the present outturn percentage 22.22 (i.e. 4.5 kg of green leaf per kg of made tea) and 21.5 percent (i.e. 4.65 kg of green leaf per kg of made tea) for calculation of the reasonable price payable for green leaf purchased by tea factories during the months of April, May, June, September, October, November, and December of each year. The present outturn percentage of 22.22 should however, be applied in respect of the balance 5 months of the year.

# Examples of Calculation of the Reasonable Price

According to the revised outturn percentage are shown overleaf.

The revised outturn percentage will take effect for the payment of green leaf purchased by tea factories on and after 1st September 1985.

Please acknowledge receipt of this circular.

Your faithfully,

Set. 6.4. re Silvan

TEA COMMISSIONER.
