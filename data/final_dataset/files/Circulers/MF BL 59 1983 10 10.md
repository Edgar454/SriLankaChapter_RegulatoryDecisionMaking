Dear Sir/Madam,

# Sale of BM Fannings

BM Fannings by public auction. The Sri Lanka Tea Board has decided to permit the sale of 2nd grade stuff. In view of it, BM Fannings must be treated as if it were food. Therefore, it will now be essential that BM Fannings to be exported and should not be consumed under care. Strict precautions must be taken in its preparation and handling at the most hygienic conditions in order to avoid microbial contamination. Every effort should be made to prevent damp conditions and also to keep out all extraneous matter.

It will be necessary for all just 25 it is necessary at due precautions to be taken in the preparation of BM Fannings for the familiar grades of tea sold to the auctions.

Yours faithfully,

Sgd. G.4 de Silva

Tea Commissioner.
