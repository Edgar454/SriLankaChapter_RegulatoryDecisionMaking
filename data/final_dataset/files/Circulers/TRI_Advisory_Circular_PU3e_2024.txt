T.R.I. ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.PUIEy

 

Issued in: February 2024 Serial No. 03/24
CHEMICAL CONTROL OF WEEDS IN TEA LANDS

(This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PU 3, Serial No. 03/23 issued in May 2023 and
previous related circulars and links with Circular No. WM1, Serial No.24/24 issued in February 2024)

Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach includes manual, mechanical, cultural and
chemical methods (in rotation) as specified in TRI Advisory Circular WM 1. The use of herbicides
has some advantages, such as selectivity and cost-effectiveness, but sometime, causes crop
damages, residue issues and environmental problems that need to be avoided by limiting the
number of applications to two rounds per annum and strictly adhering to the recommended rate.

When using herbicides, the TRI recommendations should always be followed along with a
minimum of one week Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI). Precautions should also be taken to avoid spray
drift onto the tea foliage and green stems.

1. Common Weeds

A volume of 450 - 500 L of herbicide solution is required to cover one hectare of tea field when
using a Knapsack sprayer fitted with a nozzle having a swathe of 0.5 — 1 meter at 1 - 2 bars
pressure, while holding the nozzle at 35 - 50 cm above the ground.

3. Guidelines for safe and effective use of herbicides

a) Adopt a selective spraying program in order to retain desirable weeds and to control resistant
weeds. Such resistant weeds should be treated with specific herbicides at dosages
recommended. Alternately, other more effective control measures may be adopted.

&

Select the most suitable herbicide based on the range and growth stage of weed species
present in the field. Use correct dosage of herbicide and mix thoroughly in clean water and then
make up the spray volume required to cover the area to be treated. Wash spray tanks
thoroughly in clean water before use to avoid any contamination.

Maintain the number of herbicide applications for the year to a minimum (maximum two from a
single herbicide), and use a range of herbicides of different mode of action in rotation than
continuing with a single herbicide. This would help in preventing build-up of resistant weed
species.

2

=

Do not spray herbicides on creepers growing over the tea bush. These should be pulled down
and laid on the inter-row space and then sprayed. Mature woody plants and deep-rooted
species should be slashed, and the regrown tender parts to be sprayed.

e) Spray weedicides, when weeds are relatively young, before they flower / bear seeds.

f) Select a calm day for spraying, as wind could carry the spray drift away from the intended area
of spray. Also avoid spraying during very hot period of the day.

g) Use a spray guard when spraying on the inter-rows of tea. This would prevent excessive spray
drift on to peripheral branches and green stems.

h) Use lever operated, diaphragm type Knapsack sprayers which are more appropriate for
herbicide applications. All sprayers must be checked for proper performance and, the trigger
valves and nozzles need to be checked for leaks.

i) Use the correct type of Poly jet / Flood jet nozzles (yellow: swathe 0.5 m, spray output 0.6 L per
minute or green: swathe 1.0 m, spray output 1.2 L per minute).

j) Wear protective clothing when mixing and spraying herbicides.

k) Clean the tank, nozzle and lance after use thoroughly and wash the self and protective clothing
used. Do not throw empty herbicide containers (particularly into streams and waterways).

!) Supervise the entire operation carefully to ensure safe and effective weed control.
m) Store agro-chemicals separately to prevent mishandling.

n) Maintain proper records of purchases, storage, issuance and usage of herbicides.
