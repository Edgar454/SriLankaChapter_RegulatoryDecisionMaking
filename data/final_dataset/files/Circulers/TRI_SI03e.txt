WIND AND SHELTER BELTS IN TEA

4. Objectives (This cancels the Circular No.0-2,., Serial No. 6/90, issued in October 1990)

In wind swept areas, it is advisable to establish shelter belts well before the planting
of young tea. The full blast of the wind during the months of heavy blowing could
result in:

e loss of crop in mature tea

e damage to leaf

e poor establishment of new clearings (arising from loosening of young
plants and consequent bark damage at the soil level)

2. Region-specific species

2.11n the up-country, a mixed stand of Grevillea robusta and Hakea saligna or
Acacia spp.is recommended. They should be planted at right angles towards the
direction of wind.

2.2 In the mid —country, a mixed stand of Grevillea and Acacia spp. is recommended.

2.3 Grevillea robusta could be spaced 3.6 m (12 ft) apart in the row. On either side of
Grevillea, Hakea saligna or Acacia spp. could be planted at a spacing of 1.2 —
1.8 m (4-6 ft).Alternatively, rows of Hakea or Acacia alone could be grown as
wind belts at a spacing of 1.2 - 1.8 m (4-6 ft.).

2.4 In the low-country, a mixed stand of Fragrea fragrans and Gliricidia septum is
recommended for wind belts. Fragrea fragrans could be spaced 3.6 — 4.5 m (12-
15 ft) along the row while Gliricida sepium could be planted on either side of
F.frgrans at a spacing of 1.2 — 1.5 m (4-6 ft)

3. Spacing

The spacing between rows of wind belts could be 45 — 60 m (150-200 ft)
depending on the intensity of blowing of the wind. The ideal spacing should be
ten times the height of the wind belt. On hilicrest wind belts consist of double
rows planted on a triangular arrangement is recommended at spacing given
above (para 2.3 and 2.4) for specific spps.

4. Tea as wind belt
In case wind belts are not established, tea itself could be established as wind belt

by allowing it to grow freely. However, the distance should be closer than 45 m
(150 ft)
