# EXPORTATION OF TEA

# PREPARATION OF CUSTOMS GOODS DECLARATION (CUSDEC) FORM 53

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HARMONIZED COMMODITY DESCRIPTION AND CODING SYSTEM (HSC CODE)

This refers to Circular No TCIEXIHS dated 02nd July 2010 addressed to all registered exporters of tea by the Deputy Tea Commissioner (Exports) on the subject of AMENDMENT OF HSC CODE RELATED TO TEA. This further refers to the Customs Notification Order No.01/2010 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No 1656/9 of 31st May 2010 under the Revenue Protection Act No.19 of 1962, implemented with effect from 01st June 2010.

Having verified the CUSDECs forwarded to the Sri Lanka Customs along with the relevant export documents by exporters of tea for exportation of tea through the Sri Lanka Tea Board, it is revealed that the information furnished therein have not been compatible with the newly introduced HSC Codes which are appeared in the CUSDECs, tea published in the aforesaid Gazette: Due to this primary error, export data disseminated by the Customs are shown inaccurate picture on the teas exported from Sri Lanka. Therefore, it has been decided to issue this circular indicating specific instruction for entering of HSC Codes in CUSDEC relating to the classification among the national sub-divisions according to the specific description indicated against each sub-division of the Gazette Notification. The main objective of this circular is to identify teas exported from Sri Lanka under specific category and gather accurate statistical data. Therefore, all exporters of tea shall follow the instructions laid down herein with immediate effect to avoid any unnecessary delays at the point of authorizing CUSDEC for exportation of tea.
