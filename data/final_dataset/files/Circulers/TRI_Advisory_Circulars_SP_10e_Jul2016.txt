9)  T.R.I. ADVISORY CIRCULAR No.SP Bt

Issued in: July 2016 Serial No: 01/16

Fertilizer Recommendation for Mature Tea in Small Holdings
This circular replaces Interim Circular No. SP 10, Serial No: 01/10, issued in August 2010.

The soil organic matter content in low and mid country and Uva tea growing regions are generally
low and therefore, the potential of retaining plant nutrients in these soils is also relatively low. This
leads to poor use efficiency of soil applied fertilizers in these regions. Recent assessments done in

small holder lands in these regions revealed that soil magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S) levels are
also significantly low.

Applications of mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as
Urea, Eppawela rock phosphate and Muriate of potash respectively, are recommended for mature
tea fields in 2 to 5 splits per annum. The annual requirement of N is based on the potential yield
categories. Magnesium requirement of the pruning cycle is expected to fulfill by the application of
recommended quantity of dolomite (MgCO3.CaCO3) for pH correction at the time of pruning. The
recommended quantity of dolomite is to be based on soil pH level in the latter part of the last year
of cycle. Dolomite should comply with the specifications given in the TRI Advisory Circular SP3.
Even though dolomite is applied, low nutrient retention capacities of soils may not make Mg
available for plants throughout the pruning cycle. Furthermore, Mg deficiency could also be
induced due to suppression of its uptake by the applications of higher rates of N and K containing

fertilizers. These circumstances invariably lead to lack of Mg in soil and affecting healthy plant
growth.

In view of above observations, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 were formulated
as strategic interventions to improve soil fertility status in the tea small holdings. The suitability of
new mixtures were tested in 26 small holder lands along with the other fertilizer mixtures

previously recommended by the TRI, covering different Agro-ecological regions in major tea
growing areas.

Based on the outcomes of adaptive trials, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 are
recommended for small holdings in all the tea growing regions in addition to previously
recommended fertilizer mixtures for mature VP tea fields in different tea growing regions viz.
VP/LC 880 and VP/LC 1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VP/UM 1020 for mid & up country
and VP/Uva 945 and VP/Uva 1055 for the Uva region (Table 1).

 
 

Growers may select the mixture/s to be used primarily based on the soil nutrient status, yield or
crop responses. It is advisable to use either UT 752 mixture with 100 kg of dolomite per acre per
annum or U 834 mixture if soil Mg and/or S levels are below 60 and 40 milligrams per kilogram
(ppm) respectively in all the tea growing regions. However, if soil Mg level is above 60 ppm and S
level above 40 ppm, it is appropriate to use regional specific mixtures viz. VP/LC 880 and VP/LC
1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VP/UM 1020 for mid and up country and VP/Uva 945 and
VP/Uva 1055 for Uva region.

Considering lower plant density, individual bush manuring is strongly recommended for
the fields yielding less than 130 kg green leaf/ac/month.

Since dolomite is recommended at the rate of 100 kg/ac/yr in one or two applications, as
a source of Mg when UT752 mixture is applied regularly, dolomite should be broadcast at
least four weeks prior to ground fertilizer applications.

In addition to ground fertilizer application, it is essential to apply foliar spray of Zinc
sulphate ideally within 10-14 days after each ground fertilizer application in order to
induce bud break.

The lack of yield or crop response to fertilizer application could be due to many reasons.
Factors such as weather conditions, soil properties and moisture status efc., affect the use
efficiency of applied fertilizer. It is essential to apply fertilizers when the soil is moist.

Adding organic matter in the form of compost and green manure efc., to tea fields
improves retention of moisture and applied nutrients in soil. In addition, adoption of soil
conservation measures and good agricultural practices (GAPs) significantly improves the
availability of plant nutrients. Hence, application of chemical fertilizers should not be
considered as the only solution for every constraint encountered in tea fields.
