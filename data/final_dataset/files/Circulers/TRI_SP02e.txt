FERTILISER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMATURE TEA

This Advisory Circular replaces Circular No F 9, Serial No. 01/96, issued in
January 1996 on the use of fertiliser for immature tea piants.

1 Introduction

Immature tea plants selected for vigour, apart from other desirable characters,
require generous fertiliser applications in the early stages of growth. Although
immature plants are capable of rapid development, their root systems are small
and occupy only a small soil volume from which the nutrients can be absorbed.
An adequate supply of the necessary nutrients should, therefore, be made
available for best results.

Fertilizer mixture T200 is recommended for immature tea from field planting to
the commencement of plucking. A separate fertiliser mixture, T750, with a higher
proportion of nitrogen is recommended from commencement of plucking to the
first prune. Special attention should be given to the methods and frequency of
application. The amelioration of soil pH with dolomitic limestone is also an
important operation during the immature phase.

2 Application from field planting to commencement of plucking

2.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone
Application of dolomitic limestone is recommended for the maintenance of soil pH
levels between 4.5 and 5.5 for better growth of tea.

2.1.1 Specifications
The dolomitic limestone must have a minimum of 18% MgO, and approximately
100% of particles passing through 30 mesh, and 40 to 60% of particles passing
through 100 mesh.

2.1.2 Application
Check the soil pH at the time of planting. If the pH level is below 4.5 in spite of
dolomitic limestone application during rehabilitation, apply 500 kg of dolomite per
ha in both the 1st and 2nd years, preferably during wet weather conditions.

There should be an_ interval of 4 to 6 weeks between the ground fertiliser
application and dolomite application.

Mixture - T200

Composition

100 parts Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)
50 parts Eppawela rock phosphate (28.5% P2Os)
25 parts Muriate of potash (60% K20)

_25 parts Kieserite (24% MgO)

200 parts

The mixture contains approximately 10.3% N, 6.9% P20s, 7.5% K,0 and 3.0%
MgO.

Dosage and frequency of application

Approximately two months after planting, apply T200 at the rates of 15 or 21g
per plant per application six or four times in the 1st year, and 21 or 32 g per plant
per application six or four times in the 2nd year.

Estimation of T200 requirements

At the above rates of application, the quantities of T200 mixture required per ha
(12,500 plants) are approximately:

1100 kg in the 1“ year, and
1600 kg in the 2” year

The quantities of nutrients supplied in the 1st and 2nd year are given below.

Amount of T200 Number Approximate quantities
per plant of applications of nutrients,
per application per year kg per ha per year
N P,0; K,0 MgO
1“ year 15g 6
21g 4 113 76 83 33
2™ year 21g 6
32g 4 165 110 120 48

Time of application

Where favourable weather conditions prevail, frequent applications of fertiliser are
desirable, i.e. six doses per year. In areas with prolonged dry periods, four doses
per year may be possible.

Application of fertiliser in relation to weather is important. If it is applied during
periods of heavy rain, there is a possibility of it being washed away, particularly if
the land is exposed. Fertiliser application during long periods of dry weather should
be avoided to prevent scorch or even death of young plants.
2.2.5

2.3

2.3.1

2.3.2

Method of application

In the early stages, fertiliser should be applied in a ring round the plant, at a radius
of 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8”). Care should be taken not to apply fertiliser too close to the
base of the plant as this would result in bark scorch. In steep areas, fertiliser should
be applied in a semi-circle on the upper slopes.

Fertiliser should be dibbled into the soil to a depth not exceeding 7.5 cm (3”).
Foliar applications

Foliar applications of fertiliser should be made with knapsack sprayers.

Zinc sulphate

Zinc sulphate is recofhmended at the rate of 4 to 6 kg per ha per year, in four to six
applications in the 1st year, i.e. 1 kg in 100 | of water per ha per application, within 7
- 14 days after ground fertiliser application. The quantity of ZnSO, and water should
be doubled for each of the four to six applications in the 2nd year, i.e. 2 kg in 200 |
of water per ha per application.

Nitrogen and magnesium

If deficiency symptoms of nitrogen (general yellowing) and/or magnesium
(interveinal chlorosis in lower maintenance foliage) are observed, apply 1 to 2 % of
urea and/or 1 to 2% of commercial Epsom salt. Apply 1 to 2 kg of urea and 1 to 2
kg of commercial Epsom salt per ha in 100 | of water in the 1st year, and 2 to 4 kg
of each per ha in 200 | in the 2nd year, as and when necessary.

Zinc sulphate, urea and commercial Epsom salt can be mixed together and applied
as a single foliar spray, when required. However, do not exceed 5% total salt
concentration in the final spray solution.

(N.B. Zinc sulphate and Epsom salt are both salts)

Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects

Sulphate of potash is recommended for application prior to dry spells.

A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 2 kg in 100 | of water) is recommended
at fortnightly intervals, at least a month prior to the onset of the dry period. Urea
(2%) may be included in the spray solution to enhance absorption of potassium.
No benefits could result from this foliar spray, if carried out after dry weather has
set in.

Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.

 
3 Application from commencement of plucking to the ist prune

3.1 Correction of soil pH with dolomitic limestone
Check the soil pH when the tea is brought into bearing.
If the pH is below 4.5, apply 750 kg of dolomite per ha. The next dolomite
application should be carried out at the time of the 1st prune, preferably a few
weeks before pruning.

3.2 Mixture - T750

3.2.1. Composition

500 parts Sulphate of ammonia (20.6% N)
100 parts Eppawela rock phosphate (28.5% R2Os)
100 parts Muriate of potash (60% K,0)
_50 parts Kieserite (24% MgO)
750 parts

The mixture contains approximately 13.7% N, 3.7% P2Os, 8.0% K2O0 and 1.6% MgO.
3.2.2 Dosage and frequency of application

Apply T750 at the rate of 1,750 kg per ha per year from the 3rd year onwards
until the 1st prune, in four or more applications.

The quantities of nutrients supplied are:
Nutrient (kg per ha per year)

N P,Os KO MgO
240 65 140 28

3.2.3. Method of application

At the end of 2 to 3 years, the tea should normally have been brought into plucking
and should by then form a good cover. The fertiliser could therefore be broadcast.

3.3 Foliar applications
3.3.1 Zinc sulphate
Zinc sulphate is recommended at the rate of 6 to 9 kg per ha per year until the 1“

prune. It can be applied in four to six applications, at 1.5 kg in 300 to 400 | of water
per ha per application, within 7 — 14 days after ground fertiliser application.
3.3.2

3.3.3

Nitrogen and magnesium

If deficiency of nitrogen (general yellowing) and magnesium (interveinal chlorosis
in lower maintenance foliage) are observed, apply 2 to 4% of urea and 2 to 4%
commercial Epsom salt at the rate of 8 to 12 kg of each per ha in 300 to 400 | of
water until the 1% prune, as and when necessary. The quantity of urea and
commercial Epsom salt could be adjusted depending on the severity of deficiency
symptoms. However, do not exceed 5% total sait concentration in the final spray
solution.

Sulphate of potash to mitigate drought effects

A 2% solution of sulphate of potash (i.e. 6 to 8 kg in 300 to 400 | of water) is
recommended at fortnightly intervals, at least a month prior to the onset of the
dry period. Apply the solution after harvesting to ensure its proper deposit on the
mature foliage. Urea (2%) may be included in the spray solution to enhance
absorption of potassium.

Zinc sulphate should not be mixed with sulphate of potash in the spray solution.
