# GUIDELINES ON PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF SPREAD OF COVID-19 IN TEA PLANTATIONS

Entire world has been affected by the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, commonly known as COVID-19. Sri Lanka is also currently experiencing COVID-19 threat. Globally, COVID-19 pandemic will create significant impacts on economies and Sri Lanka is not exempted being an upper middle-income country. This will certainly create adverse outcomes in the health, social and economic settings in short, medium and longer terms.

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and the transmission takes place via following 3 routes:

1. Droplets - The virus can be transmitted by breathing infected droplets. Droplets can be produced during coughing or sneezing or even by exhales from infected persons. These droplets travel up to a distance of 1m.
2. Direct - Person to person transmission by direct contact with an infected person (Eg. Hugging, Shaking hands). The virus enters the body through nose, mouth or eyes.
3. Indirect – When an infected person coughs, sneezes or exhales, droplets of infected fluid may release and contaminate nearby surfaces and objects, such as desks, tables, telephones, computers etc. An uninfected person may come in contact the virus by touching these surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.

Therefore, individual workplaces should adopt best practices to avoid such transmissions through the routes described herein. Individual behavior is also important in arresting transmission of this virus.

Two simple measures adopted in public namely wearing face masks and not touching the face could protect any individual from infecting with this virus.

In the present context, workplaces need to modify the practices and their working environments to prevent any possible transmission of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, stakeholders in the tea plantations are hereby advised to adopt the following guidelines at their workplaces viz. tea field, factory and office, while complying with the Government directives and Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medical Services guidelines issued time to time.

The staff and workers of following categories should not report for work;

1. Those having fever, with or without acute onset respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or shortness of breath.
2. Those who have had contact with suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 for the last 14 days
3. Those who are quarantined for COVID-19.

# 4. Those who are occupying premises and/or housing schemes declared as self-quarantine areas for suspected cases of COVID-19.

A large number of people are frequently gathered at the workplaces, it is a collective responsibility of persons to keep workplaces safe and healthy. The lead responsibility for the implementation of this guideline lies with the management of each organization.

All staff and workers need to adhere to the recommendations append below in order to avoid possible transmission of COVID-19 infection.
