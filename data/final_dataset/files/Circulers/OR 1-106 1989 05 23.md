Dear Sir,

# Damage to Tea Factories arising out Of Terrorist attacks

I refer to my letter No. OR/1/106 dated 21st June, 1986 wherein it was stated, that the Sri Lanka Tea Board would compensate tea factory owners for loss or damage caused to tea factories by terrorist attacks.

2. The Tea Board reviewed this matter at its meeting held on 4th May, 1989 and decided to withdraw this indemnity with immediate effect, as it does not have the financial resources to undertake this commitment.

Kours faithfully,

C.P.R. Perera

Chairman
