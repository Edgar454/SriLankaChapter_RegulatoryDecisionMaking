TO: ALL REGISTERED EXPORTERS OF TEA
Sirs,

EX?CRT OF TEA

 

It is observed that exporters prepared their consignment of tea for exportation especially
in bulk form without identifying the packagercase/chest by using a ruhning number/Lot
Nos. Due to the above reason mest of the shippe:s prepare their cargo as part shipments
with identical shipping marks and other details without indicating package numbers.
‘This will be a problem at the point of pre-shipment sampling to identify the actual cargo
for monitoring purposes.

In order to samy out pre-shipment sampling effectively you are hereby informed to
follow the under-mentioned procedure with immediate effect.

i) Running number should be stenciled oti each and every bulk package or case
up to the total number of packages of the contract.

ii) In case of partial shipment under the same contract the running number should
be continued without duplication. ‘

iii) Under marks and numibers of the CUSDEC tange of the package numbers/Loi
Nos. should be declared. .

The above system would facilitate to identify the actual number of packages of the
consignment completed and shipped both to you and the Tea Board officials, You are
therefore, requested to comply with the above requirement prior to confirming the date of
pre-shipment sampling of our officers.

Yours truly,
