Dear Sir,

Damage to Tea Factories arising
out of Terrorist attacks.

I refer to my letter No. OR/1/106 dated 2ist June, 1986
wherein it was stated, that the Sri Lanka Tea Board would compensate
tea factory owners for loss or damage caused to tea factories by terrorist

attacks.

2. The Tea Board reviewed this matter at its meeting held
on 4th May, 1989 and decided to withdraw this indemnity with immediate
effect, as it does not have the financial resources to undertake this

commitment.

 

Chairman
