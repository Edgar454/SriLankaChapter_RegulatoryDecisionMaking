In regard to the periodic adulteration of seasonal teas, complaints have arisen from the trade in relation to the "ethyl Salicylate" flavour such seasonal teas.

The Board is in consultation with the chemical authorities to ensure the Sri Lanka Tea Traders' Association and the Planters' and Tasting Association of Ceylon have appointed the following procedure for testing of seasonal teas, which will come into effect immediately:

1. On closure of brokers' sale catalogues, a preliminary tasting of samples of seasonal teas catalogued for sale will be conducted on Wednesday of the week following the closure to determine whether their character shows unusual seasonal characteristics and are suspected of being adulterated with the chemical, Methyl Salicylate.
2. Samples of teas which are suspected of adulteration will be forwarded to the Tasting Unit of the Salicylate for testing.
3. The Board will arrange a meeting of the liquoring and tasting panel for the analysis of such samples.
4. The research will be conducted by the Tea Research Institute, and the findings will be communicated to the Commissioner of the Tea.
5. In case of any findings, the samples will be subjected to further analysis under the personal supervision of the Tea Research Institute.
